#### Fanatic Swing

Required Level
:   18

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from Zeal (LoD)
:   Almost none. (The skill itself is faster to make a Sorceress attack as fast as a Paladin.)

Pros
:   Lets a Sorceress zeal roughly as fast as a Paladin. Works fine with Enchant.

Cons
:   Other defensive skills and good defensive gears are also necessary
    to stay alive in melee. Less life leech because of less weapon damage.

#### Fire Mastery

Required Level
:   30

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Improved initial damage increase. Less damage increase per level.
    Oskill Fire Mastery grants less damage increase.

Pros
:   Boosts all Fire Damage including melee/ranged Fire damage. Just 1
    hard point brings a large bonus.

Cons
:   For many skills, investing in synergies is better than investing in
    Fire Mastery after the initial point, particularly if you have a lot
    of +skills from items.

Notes
:   Pre-buff skills (specifically Enchant and Holy Fire) now receive the
    full bonus granted by Fire Mastery in R3x (\"+% To Fire Skill
    Damage\" also works like FM). Note that the fire damage on your
    weapon is further multiplied by Fire Mastery at full strength (using
    the target\'s FM, not the caster\'s), so ultimately these skills
    receive more benefit from Fire Mastery than direct damage skills. If
    Enchant is cast on a minion or player with no Fire Mastery skill of
    their own, Fire Mastery has less effect.\
    \
    For those skills, the fire damage shown in the skill description is
    \[(base \* (1 + synergies)\] \* \[1 + Fire Mastery + Fire Skill
    Damage bonus\]. The fire damage added to the melee/ranged damage in
    the LCS is then further multiplied by (1 + Fire Mastery + Fire Skill
    Damage bonus) before being added to the weapon damage.\
    \
    There has been some discussion as to whether Fire Mastery works with
    fire damage on ranged weapons, the current consensus is that it
    does.
