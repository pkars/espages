### Improve Graphic Performance With A Glide {#l932a905}

#### What A Glide Wrapper Does? {#zd522033}

-   Diablo II is optimized for Voodoo series video cards, which were
    popular among 3D gamers when it was released. Glide is the 3D
    graphics API for Voodoo cards, and D2 runs much faster in Glide mode
    than in other modes (Direct Draw/3D.) If you don\'t have a Voodoo,
    you can\'t select Glide mode.
-   In short, a Glide wrapper lets other video cards than Voodoo work in
    Glide mode, to improve the graphic performance.


#### Which Glide Wrapper Do You Recommend? {#o5e0b55b}

-   This Glide Wrapper is recommended in Eastern Sun forum [Glide Wrapper
    thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://phrozenkeep.hugelaser.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=47073).\
    [http://www.svenswrapper.de/english/downloads.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://www.svenswrapper.de/english/downloads.html)\
    A slightly more detailed guide can be found in the E.S.
    Troubleshooting & Problem Solving FAQ thread here:\
    [http://phrozenkeep.hugelaser.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54529](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://phrozenkeep.hugelaser.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54529)
-   You can find many other Glide Wrappers, too, but this one is
    optimized for Diablo II, and would work better.
-   If you are running Windows Vista with the Aero-theme activated, the
    Glide Wrapper will not function by default due to OpenGL conflicts.
    You can go around this issue by configuring your Eastern Sun
    shortcut: Go to the compatibility-tab at the shortcut properties,
    and enable \'Disable desktop compositing\'. This setting will
    disable the Vista Aero-theme every time you run ES from the
    shortcut, which allows the Glide Wrapper to run properly.
-   NOTE: The \'test version of Sven\'s Wrapper includes an option to
    automatically tun off the effects needed to run properly under
    Windows Vista/7.\

### General Tips {#ia703d8c}

-   **Repair/Recharge cost** is very low in ES. You no longer have to
    worry about the recharge cost. Superior Runeworded items will never
    bankrupt you.
-   **Other mercenaries** than Act 2 mercenaries are also useful. All
    mercenaries have useful support skill(s) like an aura, warcries,
    etc.
-   **Mercenaries hired in Hell** has the same stats as the ones hired
    in Normal (Only the aura of the Act 2 mercenaries changes each
    difficulty). You can change your mercenary without losing their
    stats, so I recommend hiring each mercenary at least once to see how
    they work.
-   **Weaken**, **Iron Maiden** and **Decrepify** reduce monster\'s
    physical resist by 60% while **Amplify Damage** reduces it by 80%.
    Now Amplify Damage isn\'t the only melee curse to be considered.
-   **Inner Sight** also reduces monster\'s physical damage by 5-35%
    (more than 70% when fully synergized), and this works on top of
    another curse.
-   **Damage Augmenter** is a free bonus charm included in the starting
    items. All characters should have one. You can make one by a cube
    recipe for your old characters.

        Wirt's Leg + Tome of Identify -> Damage Augmenter


### Getting Started {#of0f08ce}

Starting out in Eastern Sun for the first time, or playing
[untwinked](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Glossary#untwinked "Glossary (10d)")
can be quite a challenge. Here are a few tips that should make it
easier:

#### Tactics {#wac5d352}

-   You start out with a very low chance to hit, so go after easy
    targets like Fallen until you gain a couple levels.
-   (Edit) All monsters\' life was roughly doubled in R5, and characters
    are given 500 fulminating potions instead, which would let you gain
    a few levels with ease.

::: {.ie5}
Monster       Level  Remarks  Monster            Level  Remarks
--------     ------  -------  ----------------  ------  -------
Fallen       2                Dark Spearwoman    3      Fast
Quillrat     2                Gargantuan Beast   3      Stun
Zombie       2       Slow     Hungry Dead        3      Slow
Dark Hunter  3       Fast     Skeleton           3
:::
-   Please note even the weakest monsters have a twice higher level than
    you, and this level difference make it very difficult to hit
    monsters. Attack Rating would be given the highest priority.
-   Don\'t be afraid to flee back to town and start a new game if you
    get too many monsters coming after you at once.
-   Every character class can benefit from a javelin/shield combo early
    on. This gives you the benefit of ranged combat (thrown), or melee
    combat with the additional defense of a shield. Also, cubing any
    javelin/throwing/quiver by itself, resets the quantity to 255.
    Useful to remember if you are out in the wilderness and you get the
    low quantity warning.

#### Equipments {#h3eef473}

-   **Socketables**: Don\'t be afraid to stick the socketables you find
    into a weapon or piece of armor\...you can take them out anytime you
    want by putting the socketed item in your Horadric Cube together
    with a key. Nothing is destroyed, you get your gems, jewels, or
    runes back, as well as the item they were in.
-   **Gemwords/Runewords**: Everyone can benefit from
    [gemwords](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3gemw_n.htm)
    early on. If you fill all the sockets in a white item with the same
    type and quality of gem, you\'ll get a CtC skill as well as the
    listed bonuses. Many useful low level
    [runewords](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3runew_n.htm)
    are also available.
-   **Buying Gems**: Wish you had more gems of a certain type? You can
    buy more from Akara, or make a pgem using [Secret Recipie
    \#14](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#sec).
-   **Socket Weapons/Armor**: Following list shows the maximum socket
    numbers of the items available in normal Act 1. Because socketables
    are so powerful and flexible, it\'s a good idea to stock one or two
    of maximum socket items when you find them at the shop, for you and
    your hireling. Please also note hirelings can equip gloves, belt and
    boots in ES.

::: {.ie5}
               Max Sockets                Max Sockets
-------------  ----------- -------------- -----
Melee Weapons   2-3        Bows/Crossbows 3
Helms           2          Gloves         2
Body Armor      3          Belts          2
Shields         3          Boots          2
:::
-   **3 Socket Helms**: If you need more sockets, the [3 socket Mask,
    etc.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#nor)
    from Decipherers may be worth cubing. These are the only 3 socket
    helms available early on.
-   **Sash/Light Belt Upgrade**: Any Sashes and Light Belts can be
    [upgraded to a
    Belt](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#bas)
    by cubing with a Stamina Pot.
-   **Gambling**: Gambling is much better in ES than in vanilla, you
    have a 5% chance each of getting a set or unique item. That means
    you have a 1:20 chance of finding each\...about 1 in 10 items you
    gamble will be either a unique or a set item. You can check out the
    [set](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3set_n.htm)
    or unique
    [weapons](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3uweap_n.htm)/[armor](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3uarmo_n.htm),
    and get one that looks nice.
-   **Set Item Conversion**: Some Set Items can be
    [converted](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#set)
    into a piece of another set or another base item by cubing with a
    Thawing Pot.
-   **Starter\'s Weapons**: Need a good weapon for getting started? With
    a normal and a chipped gem (depending on what skill tab bonus you
    would like to have), a decipherer, and a magic jewel you can make a
    very good magic weapon, with 1-2 sockets, +1-2 to one of your skill
    trees, and either 100% enhanced damage with 15-20% IAS (for
    ranged/melee weapons), or +1 to class skills, +20-40 mana, and +4-6
    mana per kill (for caster weapons) using the [Starter\'s
    Weapon](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#mag)
    recipes. You can also get a prefix and a suffix, if you get a good
    one, that recipie can produce an excellent item.
-   **Skill Tab Rings/Amulets**: You can also boost your skill levels by
    crafting +to skill-tab rings/amulets, e.g. +3 to Lightning Skills
    (Sorceress Only). With three decipherers, a normal gem (of a
    specific type), and a class-only ring/amulet, you can create a piece
    of jewelry which gives +1-3 to a skill tab. Like the Starter\'s
    Weapon recipie, it can also get a prefix and a suffix\...and since
    it uses class-only jewelry, there\'s also a chance you could get
    +1-3 to your favorite skill. The exact recipies can be found on the
    ES database, in the
    [ring/amulet](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#rin)
    section. Scroll down until you see \"Skill Tab Re-roll\".


#### Getting Gold {#i13a7f06}

-   If you\'re looking for something to pick up to make lots of gold at
    the shop early on, it\'s javelins and throwing daggers you should
    keep your eye out for, since they\'re worth more in ES. Wands/Orbs
    are much less expensive in ES than in vanilla, so if you play
    Necromancer or Sorceress, look through Akara\'s inventory of items
    for sale\...you might find something nice that you can afford.

<!-- -->

-   Also keep your eye out for throwing potions. Rancid Gas and Oil
    Potions are worth the most. A full stack (500) can sell for 10\'000
    in Normal, and almost twice that in nightmare. A quick tip: don\'t
    sell them right away when you find them. If you find only one, cube
    with a rejuvination potion to bring it to 255, then save it until
    you find another one. Rejuv that one to 255, put them together to
    fill one, then rejuv the other back to 255 and save. Sell the one
    that\'s full, and repeat. Also remember, if you\'re farming in
    Normal but you\'ve made it to Nightmare, save your Oil Potions and
    Rancid Gas and sell them when you go back to Nightmare.

<!-- -->

-   [SELL 2 D-STONES FOR 121,500 GOLD]{.underline}. Here\'s how; 1) Get
    2 DStones 2) Get Secret Scroll\#14 3) Make PGem 4) Use Gem Can to
    Downgrade to 9 Flawless 5) Sell for 13,500 gold each. \[logger120\]

<!-- -->

-   Remember you can convert a spare Ancient Scroll into a D-Stone (with
    a key), so a Scroll is worth 60,750 gold.\[logger120\]

#### Other Important Items {#se91db86}

-   Make sure to identify all the Ancient Scrolls you find by cubing
    them with Ancient Decipherers\...low numbered Ancient Scrolls are
    easy to find in Act 1, and several of the [Secret
    Recipies](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#sec)
    they contain will allow you to make things that are very valuable
    early on:
    -   Ancient Scroll \#4 allows you to make normal (but not
        exceptional/elite) unique items
    -   Ancient Scroll \#5 allows you to make normal set items
    -   Ancient Scroll \#14 can turn two [Dragon
        Stones](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Glossary#dragon_stone "Glossary (10d)")
        into a perfect gem (which you can split into lower level req
        gems using the [Gem
        Can](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Glossary#gem_can "Glossary (10d)"),
        or use for crafting recipies)

<!-- -->

-   If you get more than one of the same scroll, you can either try to
    get a scroll you don\'t have, by trasmuting two extra scrolls into a
    new scroll (two scrolls in the range 1-25 give outputs in the range
    1-30, scrolls from 26-50 give outputs in the range 20-50), or you
    can turn your extra scroll into a
    [D-Stone](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Glossary#dragon_stone "Glossary (10d)"),
    by transmuting it with a key.

<!-- -->

-   Wish you had more decipherers for all those nice crafting recipies,
    or to identify your Ancient Scrolls? You can split a D-Stone into 8
    decipherers using the
    [multi-stocker](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Glossary#multi-stocker "Glossary (10d)"),
    which can be useful early on. You can also get decipherers by
    transmuting organs in your cube: it takes six hearts or souls, or
    two of any other organ to make an Ancient Decipherer. You may prefer
    to save most organs for
    [tinkering](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#tin),
    but if you aren\'t interested in the tinkering mod given by a
    certain organ, turn your extras into decipherers. Unwanted
    unique/set items (armor/weapons) can also be turned into decipherer
    points by cubing with a Multi Stocker.

<!-- -->

-   Wish you had more Dragon Stones? Once you make it to Act II, you can
    pick up as many as you need by doing [HoD
    runs](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Glossary#hod_runs "Glossary (10d)").
-   IMHO a much better method is to do quick clears of Normal Levels
    (anything from regular Act 1 levels to Cows) at a high player
    setting with a character that has a good area attack (Auradins are
    best if your level is very high as the aura damage will kill all
    monsters as soon as they come on screen, leaving you free to sort
    through the loot) and pick up only important items like dstones,
    Ancient scrolls, rings/ammys, charms and such.


### Preparation for Hell difficulty {#kf525da9}

You may remember playing in Hell got much harder in LoD 1.10 than in
1.09. You may feel the same thing in ES, because of the greater resist
penalty and all monsters hitting hard. This is because all items are
highly enhanceable in ES, and it\'s supposed that most players have some
decent equipment.

But for the first time play, players are often misled by the fact that
Normal and Nightmare are rather easy in ES, and enter Hell without any
preparation to face a hard time.

In the long history of ES, many recipes have been added by the
requests/suggestions, and ES cube recipes will look very complicated for
beginners. In this section, it will be explained how to prepare for
Hell, mainly how to enhance your equipments.


#### Treasure Hunting and Leveling {#bf06a068}

-   If it\'s not the first character to enter Hell (and has some decent
    equipments), you may need no specific preparation. But for the first
    time play I strongly recommend to do treasure hunting and leveling
    in Nightmare, say in Cow Level, Lost Farm, Marsh of Pain and WSK.
-   You may not believe monsters drop any good items in Nightmare, and
    like to play in Hell soon. But you can get the best resist charms
    and skiller charms in Nightmare, and you will collect cubing
    materials more efficiently because you can play in a higher players
    setting there.
-   Those special areas in Nightmare aren\'t a bad place to level,
    either. You don\'t need to level consciously. While repeating
    treasure hunting, your character\'s level will hit 70 soon. The
    character level makes a lot of difference in hell because the chance
    to hit depends on the difference of character level and monster
    level.

#### The Items to Watch for {#sb815fda}

-   **Dragon Stones (=8 Decipherers):** Cow King drops 8 D-Stones at the
    first kill. Organs and unwanted sets/uniques can be cubed into
    Decipherers. (Change in RD series. Anya now gives Dstones upon
    rescue)
-   **Gems:** Gem Can is useful to collect gems.
-   **Runes:** NM Cows drop up to \"No\" runes (the lowest gold rune).
    For runewords and base upgrade recipes.
-   **Charms:** Resistance charms will help a lot in Hell where you
    suffer a heavy resistance penalty. Even junk charms are worth
    Keeping for rerolling.
-   **Ancient Scrolls:** You may like to get Scroll \#27 to reroll rare
    charms before you enter Hell. When you finish Nightmare, your
    character\'s level will be enough high to reroll a rare charm,
    because you can get most useful mods on rare charms around clvl 60,
    and the highest mods aren\'t available on rares anyway.


#### Resistance {#jbaa944a}

-   The lack of resistance can be lethal. It\'s preferable that all
    resistances are at least 75% in Hell. But it\'s also true that
    resistances tend to be redundant later, by getting better items and
    rescuing Anya in Hell.
-   **Charms:** Charms are the most flexible way to gain resistances.
    Before entering Hell, getting a couple of resist charms in NM will
    greatly help.
-   **Gems and Jewels** Another flexible way. Gems are easy to get and
    have nice resistances, but please note that you must put them in the
    shield or belt for the resistance. If your character uses a two
    handed weapon, the belt is the only and precious slot. The Torso
    Armor also uses Shield Gem type so it is also useful to get resists.
-   **[Forging](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#for):**
    Forgings are now \"removable\", too. One forging grants 16% All
    Resistance. But you may like to spend forgings for the skill bonus
    or max life.
-   **[D-Stoning](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3cube_n.htm#dst):**
    While all resist charms are very difficult to get, it\'s quite handy
    to D-stone all resists which only requires a D-Stone for 4% all
    resists. On the other hand, it may not a good idea to D-Stone
    resists, because D-Stoning can\'t be removed and resists tend to be
    redundant later. If you need to D-Stone resists anyway, D-Stone the
    cheapest item, because you only have to give up that cheap item when
    you don\'t need resists in future.


#### Life {#f393e5ef}

-   It would be safe for casters to have 3000-4000 life in Hell, for
    melee characters, 5000-6000.
-   You can do with less life once you get godly equipment (killing
    power, defense, damage reduction, elemental absorbs, etc.). You may
    like to replace some life enhancement with other offensive
    enhancements later.

<!-- -->

-   Example (Level 70 melee Amazon)
    -   Vitality: 280
    -   Base Life: 1087
    -   Life from equipments: 150
    -   Life from charms: 150
    -   **Life:** 1387
    -   Forging (6 times): Max Life 16 \* 6 = +96%\
        (Gloves, Belt, Boots, Ring, Unique Charms \*2)
    -   D-Stoning (30 times): Max Life 4 \* 30 = +120%\
        (10 times each for gloves, belt and boots)
    -   Level 15 Battle Orders from Act 5 Defense Barbarian: Max Life
        +80%
    -   **Total Max Life%:** 296%
    -   **Total Life:** 1387\*396%=5492\
        (Required D-Stones:54, Required P-Gems:6)


#### Oskill Battle Orders, etc. {#d7708035}

-   **Call To Arms (LoD Runeword):** A favorite runeword. Baal himself
    can drop an Ohm decal in Nightmare, but Cows can\'t.
-   **Lifecleaver (unique ancient axe):** this can be very good until
    you can get Call to Arms (sure, if you want BO in secondary weapon).
    You can gamble in nightmare at level 58 for better chance
-   **of Skillmaster (Suffix):** Rings, amulets, helms, body armor and
    spears can have the suffix of level 1-12 Battle Orders. The affix
    level is 56. Spears include javelins, which are 1 handed (can be
    equipped with a skiller shield) and good for the second weapon.
    Don\'t overlook any rare javelins! Oskill Oak Sage is fragile, but
    easier to get and better than nothing. Please note that Vigor has
    Max Life% bonus, too.
-   **Defensive Barbarian:** If you don\'t have any oskill BO, and your
    character often dies in Hell, I strongly recommend hiring a
    Defensive Barbarian mercenary. They are much tougher than desert
    mercenaries, and their BO and Shout make the character and
    themselves even tougher. It\'s not too late to consider other
    mercenaries after you find an oskill BO.


#### Max Life% {#yf79741f}

-   A very strong effect which 1.08 Shako had. Abolished in the current
    version of LoD, but easy to get in ES. Why don\'t you utilize it a
    lot?
-   **Forging:** One forging grants 16% Max Life. As stated in
    \"Resists\" section, skill forging is also attractive, but life
    would be more important when your character often dies in Hell.
    Also, the cost of Stat forging is about half of skill forging. If
    you have a limited number of Anvil Stones, 32% more life would work
    better than +1 to skill levels.
-   **D-Stoning:** Well, you can\'t remove D-Stoning. But unlike
    resists, more life is always better. So there is less chance to
    regret D-Stoning Max Life% later. [Item
    Enhancement](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement "ItemEnhancement (127d)")
    page introduces fully life D-Stoned Achilles\' set, which can be the
    final gear for most melee builds and mercenaries.


#### Life Leech {#d12fa0a2}

-   If you often die in closed combats, the life leech may not be
    enough. With godly weapons, less leech will suffice, but with
    moderate weapons, you will need more leech than you need in LoD.
-   **D-Stoning:** D-Stoning rings and amulets is one way to add life
    leech. Low unique/rare jewelry like Ring of Vengeance or dual leech
    rares is a good base of D-Stoning Life Leech. Fully D-Stoned RoV can
    have 40% Life Leech or more, for example. D-Stoned cheap jewelry can
    be more effective than high level unique jewelry, depending on your
    setup.
-   Other good methods are Gem-melding Skulls on your weapon and gloves
    if you need both Life and Mana leech or socketing a Skull or Ya rune
    in the Weapon/Gloves. A very good method (especially for melee
    Mercs) is to Ya-forge Jewels.


#### Cannot Be Frozen {#ee3b0207}

-   If you have no CBF on equipments, find a Fu rune or better in NM Cow
    and downgrade it to Fu.
-   If you can prepare 2 Fu runes, forge it onto some equipment to get
    CBF.

#### Damage Reduction% {#xffed21d}

-   Of course more DR% is better. But tons of DR% isn\'t indispensable
    as long as you have enough life.

#### Curses / Auras {#sa7be79a}

-   At least one of oskill **Lower Resist** or **Conviction** would be a
    must for casters. Both are available on mid level
    runewords/gemwords. Hireling a Conviction Mercenary or Offensive
    Barbarian would also be ok. It\'s ideal to have both.
-   Physical attackers and Druid summoners will need one of physical
    resistance reduction curses (**Amplify Damage**, **Decrepify**,
    **Weaken** or **Iron Maiden**). CtC curses would be ok for physical
    attackers, but Druid summoners will need an oskill curse unless they
    use a special item like a Strafe oskill bow. If you can\'t find any
    good oskill curses, I recommend making a Unique Great Axe, which has
    an oskill Amplify Damage. Fully synergized Inner Sight can also
    reduce enemy\'s physical resistance fairly well. A curse and Inner
    Sight stack one another, so it\'s ideal to have both.


### Finding Specific items {#j17671fb}


#### Runes and Ancient Decals {#lcc0dd52}

Monsters drop Ancient Decals in the same way as they drop Runes. The
reward of Hellforge Quest isn\'t a monster drop and never drops Ancient
Decals. But all other monsters can drop both Runes and Ancient Decals.
In following sentences, the word \"Runes\" includes \"Ancient Decals\"\
Runes aren\'t magic items, so Magic Find doesn\'t increase [or
reduce]{.underline} the chance of their drop.\
More players in the game increases all drops including runes. As an
exception, Countess\' special rune drop isn\'t affected by the number of
players.\
Of course more monsters drop more runes, so crowded areas like Cow Level
and Lost Farm are good place to find runes.\
Belhifeits and Cyclopes drop runes instead of their organ (roughly 1/60
chance), in addition to the ordinary rune drop.

#### Ancient Scrolls {#s80f76a8}

Ancient Scrolls aren\'t magic items and Magic Find doesn\'t work,
either. Only more players can increase the chance of their drop.\
Izual drops an Ancient Scroll instead of his organ (roughly 1/60
chance), and he can drop up to 5 items. More players slightly increases
his drop. He is the only exception and there are no other special
monsters or areas for finding Ancient Scrolls. (Izual\'s Ghost added in
R4B has a slightly better chance to drop Ancient Scrolls, too.)\
You can cube a low level Ancient Scroll from a Cookbook, and you can
cube a Cookbook from DragonStones, so collecting Dragon Stones is
another way to enrich your bookshelf.

#### Crystals {#re2a1259}

Crystals are new items that are used to cube Uber Organs and Kanji
Runes. They are found in Ores which serve as a container for them.
Crystals are extracted by cubing the ore with itself. An empty ore has
no further use.

The crystals contained in an ore are randomly determined, just like mods
on a rare item. An ore may contain only one crystal, or even no crystal
at all. All monsters have a very slim chance to drop an ore. This chance
is doubled in Nightmare and tripled in Hell. These ores may contain 0-6
chipped crystals (0-1 crystal of each kind), but 2 crystals on average.

Listed below are some particular bosses that have an extra chance to
drop a higher quality or a \'boss\' ore.

There is no difference in appearance between normal ores and boss ores,
but the latter tends to contain more crystals.

    Boss ores have a high chance to contain a kind of crystal related to that boss (0-4).
    Boss ores have a mid chance to contain 3 kinds of crystals loosely related to that boss (0-1).
    Boss ores have a low chance to contain other 9 kinds of crystals (0-1).

In theory a boss ore can contain 15 crystals at best, but 3 or 4 on
average.

### Gambling {#l522632d}

-   Since the Gambling of D2 has a hard-coded clvl dependant formula and
    is difficult to tweak, the Gambling had been changed many times in
    ES. In the latest version, most gambling problems have been fixed by
    introducing Gambling Chits.
-   The difficulty doesn\'t matter for gambling any longer.


#### Unique/Set/Rare Chance {#ja5f5934}

-   The chance of getting a unique item is increased from 0.05% to 5%.
-   The chance of getting a set item is increased from 0.1% to 5%.
-   The chance of getting a rare item is increased from 10% to 30%.



#### ilvl (item level) {#ufd9d8b2}

-   The ilvl of gambled item randomly varies between your clvl -5 and
    your clvl +4.
-   The ilvl must be equal to or higher than the qlvl of the base item.
    -   If the ilvl is less than the qlvl of a specific item, that item
        simply doesn\'t appear on the window. For example, if you see a
        pair of Gauntlets (qlvl = 29) on the window, it means its ilvl
        is 29 or higher.
-   The ilvl must be equal to or higher than the level of the set/unique
    item.
    -   If the ilvl isn\'t enough for a specific set piece, that item
        turns into a magic item.
    -   If the ilvl isn\'t enough for a specific unique, that item turns
        into a rare item.

#### Exceptional/Elite Chance {#eb0de2bc}

-   The parameter for exceptional is increased from 0.9% to 1.5%.
-   The parameter for elite is increased from 0.33% to 2.5%.

<!-- -->

    min Exceptional chance = ((clvl - 5) - qlvl of the exceptional item) * 1.5% + 1%
    max Exceptional chance = ((clvl + 4) - qlvl of the exceptional item) * 1.5% + 1%

    min Elite chance = ((clvl - 5) - qlvl of the elite item) * 2.5% + 1%
    max Elite chance = ((clvl + 4) - qlvl of the elite item) * 2.5% + 1%

    Where (clvl - 5) or (clvl + 4) is the actual ilvl of the gambled item.

-   This formula is quoted from the Arreat Summit (ie. may be wrong).
-   It seems Exceptional is checked first, and then Elite is, because
    100% chance of Exceptional results no Elite at all.
-   Much improved from the LoD chance, but please note the high level
    elites are still very difficult to gamble. Please consider buying
    gambling chits for those items.


#### Gambling Chits {#ta71d967}

-   Anya and Larzuk sell Gambling Chits as an alternative of gamblimg.
-   Gambling Chits are cubed into an item, and the result is random just
    like gambling.
-   The price of each Gambling Chit is fixed. (Roughly equal to the
    gambling cost when you finish that difficulty.)
    -   This fixed price is very helpful when you need a normal piece
        but have only very high level characters. (Gambling an Achilles
        set piece with a level 90 character is a waste of gold, for
        example.)
    -   Please check the gambling cost, too. If the gambling cost is
        cheaper, gambling can be better.
-   Gambling Chits have the same chance for Unique/Set/Rare as gambling.
-   Normal Gambling Chits have no chance for upper items. (ilvl = 45)
-   Nightmare Gambling Chits have 50% chance for exceptionals. (ilvl
    = 65)
-   Hell Gambling Chits have 33% chance for exceptionals and 33% for
    elites. (ilvl = 85)
    -   These fixed chance are very helpful to get high level elites
        which are very difficult to gamble.
-   Anya and Larzuk always sell all kind of Gambling Chits.
    -   This feature is convenient when you can\'t use Gamble Filter.
    -   You can reset Anya\'s window by entering the red portal.
    -   You can reset Larzuk\'s window by visiting an WP. (Ancient\'s
        Way is usually safe.)


#### Gamble Filter {#gc58458e}

-   Gamble Filter is a Windows utility to filter the items on the gamble
    screen. Mac users can\'t use this utility. Gambling Chits may be
    helpful in such cases, because you can buy at least 1 chit per
    visit.
-   You can run Gamble Filter without exiting ES. (You can use Alt+Tab
    to switch applications.) But you have to make a new game after you
    edit the items on the gamble screen.

#### What level should I gamble at, and how? {#x1fbac1f}

-   [Blinn\'s

        My general rule of thumb is to hopefully be at least 10-15 levels above the qlvl of the
        target item. That means if I want to gamble for a Unique Basinet (qlvl = 40), I won't
        even try for it until I'm at least level 50.

        The bottom 1/2 of exceptional base items are usually reasonably doable with gambling,
        you should be able to get 10 levels past their qlvls before chits show up. For the
        higher 1/2 of items (say...the higher 3 types of boots for instance), the cost and
        high qlvl makes chits a better bet.

        For elite items, it's even worse. Gambling the very low tier elites is not too expensive
        and doable (maybe up to about Viper Hands). The best elites have sky high qlvls and
        incredible gambling costs. With the gambling route you'll go broke very very quickly
        and the chance isn't going to be good. Katana's for instance have a qlvl of 83. By my
        "rule" I technically should wait till lvl 93-95ish to try and gamble it. That's
        waaaaaaayyyyyyy too long of a wait, and by that time the gamble cost for a Katana is
        obscene. Meanwhile chits will have shown up much earlier and give a flat 33% chance of
        elite...very reasonable.

        Besides Act 1 normal I almost stick entirely with chits. 50% chance of exceptional for
        NM chits, and 33% chance of elite for Hell chits. Those are unbeatable odds when you
        look at how gambling treats you, and you don't need to fuss around with formulas...
        quick and simple. Sure chits only come in Act 5, but to me it is worth going 4 acts
        without gambling for.

### Breaking Immunities {#uead78a2}

-   To negate 1% monster\'s resistance beyond 100%, you need 5% lower
    resistance effect from the skills.
-   The lower resistance effect from items can\'t negate the resistance
    beyond 100%, but it works once other skills break the immunity.

::: {.ie5}

-   Lower Resist can reduce Magic and Poison Resist by the synergy from

-   Unique bosses are spawned with random mods, some of them give extra
    resistances and make them invulnerable immune.

### Caps for Resist, DR%, etc. {#m4507181}

::: {.ie5}
Mod | Cap | Remarks
------|-|-
Damage Reduced by XX% (Physical Resist) | 50% | 1
Damage Reduced by XX | none | 2
F/C/L/P Resist | 75% | 3
Magic Resist | 75% | 4
F/C/L Absorb% | 40% | 5
F/C/L Absorb | none |
Magic Reduced by XX | none | 6
:::

1.  More DR% than 50% still has a meaning when cursed. (Amplify Damage
    increases damage by 80%, So 130% DR grants 50% DR when Amp\'ed.)
2.  DR is less effective than DR%, and most players tend to neglect DR,
    but dozens of DR is actually very helpful. Normal (non-boss)
    monsters usually deal less than 200 damage in Hell Act 5 (ex.
    Enslaved in Bloody Foothills deals 136-182 melee damage). So even 20
    DR reduces a fair amount of such \"daily\" damage. Also, DR works
    beside DR% which has the cap, and it reduces some spell damages like
    Diablo Lightning.
3.  The cap can be raised up to 95% by +Max Resist equipment. Hirelings
    are penalized by the difficulty, but monions aren\'t.
4.  The cap can be raised up to 95% by +Max Resist equipment. No penalty
    by the difficulty exists, which is why you can live without any
    Magic Resist.
5.  Absorb and Absorb% heals first.\
    (ex) When a monster deals 100 Fire Damage and you have 40% Fire
    Absorb, first your life is healed by 40 (100 x 40%), and then you
    take 60 Fire Damage (100 - 100 x 40%).
    -   X% Absorb negates 2 x X% Elemental Damage at best. (When the
        character is injured.)
    -   X% Absorb negates X% Elemental damage at worst. (When the
        character is fully healed.)
6.  While X Absorb negates 2 x X Elemental Damage at best, MDR always
    negates only X Elemental damage (Roughly speaking 1/2 effect). But
    it reduces all four elemental damages and magic (bone, holy) damage.
    Dozens of MDR is helpful as well as dozens of DR.


### Moved from the readme (Need to be rearranged) {#i982b26c}


#### Character Backup {#r8d9adea}

-   Your characters and shared stash are saved in \"Diablo
    II\\es300r\\save\". You are recommended to backup this folder from
    time to time.



#### PlugY Usage {#f5f363e0}

-   The button with an X on the skill panel resets the skill points.
-   [Alt + click on the stat button to unassign the stat points
    by 1.]{.underline} In the latest version, you need to run the
    character utility to reassign the stat points, which is installed in
    the start menu. (If the utility doesn\'t load your character, assign
    all remaining stat points first.)
-   Pressing Shift increases the handled amount of the stat points to
    5.\
    You can share gold between characters via **Take Gold** and **Put
    Gold** buttons besides\
    the gold window in the stash.
-   The shared stash and multiple personal stashes are self-explanatory.
-   A huge shared stash makes ES take a longer time to be launched, and
    can cause a join failure in TCP/IP games. Please keep the shared
    stash tiny as possible, say less than 100 pages, and use the
    personal stash and mule characters instead.



#### Map Regeneration Setting {#x5c3c0b9}

-   To disable the map regeneration in single play, please use \'ES 3.00
    R preference\' shortcut in the Start menu, instead of editing
    PlugY.ini directly.


#### Hosting/Joining TCP/IP Games {#c857e888}

-   You can find the players to play with in this thread.\
    [http://phrozenkeep.planetdiablo.gamespy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=34974](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://phrozenkeep.planetdiablo.gamespy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=34974)
-   All players must use the same version of ES, so please check the
    latest patch before you host or join a TCP/IP game. (The version of
    LoD doesn\'t matter.)
-   Please DON\'T ACCESS THE SHARED STASH IN TCP/IP GAMES as possible.
    If you forget to switch back to the normal stash and quit the game,
    (or if D2 crashes during you access the shared stash), the normal
    stash is destroyed. People do forget, so please make it a rule never
    to access the shared stash in TCP/IP games.



#### TCP/IP Hosting with a Router {#x70992c0}

-   If you host with a router, you need to open TCP/UDP port 4000,
    6112-6119. D2 can\'t display the correct external IP address when
    you use a router.\
    (192.168.xxx.xxx is the internal IP address and can\'t be used for
    multiplay.)\
    You can see your external IP address at
    [http://www.whatismyip.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128175730/http://www.whatismyip.com/)



#### Gamble Filter {#x1967bb9}

-   Gamble Filter lets you limit the items shown in the gamble screen.
    Check the\
    items you like to gamble, press \"Set Filter\" button and restart
    the game. You\
    can switch to Gamble Filter by Alt+Tab without exiting D2, but you
    need to\
    restart the game to make it take effect. This feature is for single
    and TCP/IP\
    play only. Please make sure to reset the filter before you host a
    TCP/IP game.
