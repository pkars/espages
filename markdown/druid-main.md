## General {#top}

### Overview
Druid summoners, one of the weakest builds in LoD is counted as one
of the most recommended builds in ES. You can summon a Water
Elemental (the successor of Grizzly) and a kind of wolves at once.
And more summons of each kind are allowed by the synergy.

In Elemental tree, the clumsy skills like Arctic Blast and Molten
Boulder are much improved. Wind skills and new magic damage skills
synergize each other, so you can easily attain two kinds of damage
sources. More spells are castable in wereform, and shapeshifters have
more options for subskills.

Wereforms, especially Elemental Form (the successor of Werebear) greatly
benefits from on-weapon IAS, and ES recipes allow more than hundred
percent IAS on the weapon. Finally your normal attack speed in Elemental
Form will be faster than the fastest Zeal! Werewolf isn\'t drastically
changed, but is well improved to meet the ES standard.
