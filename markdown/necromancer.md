## General {#top}

### Overview
The Necromancer summoner is a good starter class in Eastern Sun,
because \'+3 To Skill Tab\' Rings and Amulets are easily and cheaply
acquired and Necromancer summoners usually need only the Summoning
tree. Aura items are abundant as well, and benefit your minions a
lot. Annihilation aura, for example, grants Crushing Blow, which
works very well with the Paladin\'s Zeal, but even better with an
entire army of minions.

The Poison and Bone Necromancer is also an excellent choice. While Lower
Resist does not reduce resistances to these spells, there is a new curse
which does.

The Necromancer has also acquired some new skills, allowing for new
kinds of builds.

Hydra and Blade Fury will allow you to think of some new tactics
previously unavailable to the classic Necromancer. Most debilitating
curses have an innate physical resistance reducing effect. This allows
all of those curses to be used in conjunction with Corpse Explosion.
Iron Maiden will be better than Amplify damage when your minions are
fewer than your enemies, for example.

Melee Necromancers are not easy but can be viable, even in Hell
difficulty, if they have decent gear, and are a fun challenge.
