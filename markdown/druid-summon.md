#### Cow Balloon {#z4a7de80}

Required Level
:   1

Prerequisites
:   *None*

A new ES skill
:   A spammable Decoy, which is fragile against melee attacks, but lasts
    longer against missile attacks and immune against elemental attacks.
    Has thorns and lightning thorns effect, and damages melee attackers.

Pros
:   Handy to attract ranged attacks/spells. Can be used as mines against melee attackers.

Cons
:   Each balloon doesn\'t last long, so you must keep casting to stop melee attackers.

#### Raven {#e714c51f}

Required Level
:   1

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Much improved damage. Has the chance of Crushing Blow instead of
    Blindness effect, which overrides curses and is annoying in late games.

Pros
:   Increases the number of Wolves and Water Elementals as a synergy.

Cons
:   The ability of Ravens themselves isn\'t much impressive.

#### Oak Sage {#v6dbc932}

Required Level
:   6

Prerequisites
:   *Cow Balloon (1)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   You can summon multiple spirits by the synergy.

Pros
:   Max life bonus helps any characters. Party friendly.

Cons
:   You can summon one kind of spirit at once. Spirits are slightly less
    reliable than auras because they may die.

#### Summon Spirit Wolf {#f801536e}

Required Level
:   6

Prerequisites
:   *Raven (1)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Much improved damage. More wolves can be summoned by the synergy.

Pros
:   More wolves can be summoned than Summon Dire Wolf. Many weak summons
    can work better than few strong summons in some cases (ex. with
    Annihilation or Iron Maiden).

Cons
:   Each wolf is weaker than a Dire Wolf. Has no special ability like
    Dire Wolf\'s Fenris Rage.

Known Issues
:   The skill icon shows slightly less All Resists and Damage Reduction
    bonus. Please see the skill panel for the correct values. The skill
    panel doesn\'t show the correct value either while the slvl is zero.

#### Heart of Wolverine {#e7cfe4f6}

Required Level
:   18

Prerequisites
:   *Cow Balloon (1), Oak Sage (6)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   You can summon multiple spirits by the synergy.

Pros
:   Offensive than Oak Sage. Party friendly if there are melee characters.

Cons
:   You can summon one kind of spirit at once. Spirits are slightly less reliable than auras because they may die.

#### Summon Dire Wolf {#i863abb0}

Required Level
:   18

Prerequisites
:   *Raven (1), Summon Spirit Wolf (6)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Much improved damage. More wolves can be summoned by the synergy.

Notes
:   Dire Wolves eat corpses to gain +100% Damage (Fenris Rage). But this
    isn\'t specially good, because wolves eventually gain hundreds %
    Damage bonus from the passive bonus of Water Elemental, auras, etc.

Pros
:   Each wolf is stronger than a Spirit Wolf. Dire Wolves use Fenris
    Rage.

Cons
:   Less wolves can be summoned than Summon Spirit Wolf.

Known Issues
:   The skill icon shows slightly less Life, All Resists and Damage
    Reduction bonus. Please see the skill panel for the correct values.
    The skill panel doesn\'t show the correct value either while the
    slvl is zero.
