## General {#top}

### Overview
Item dependant to some extent, but the ranged builds (Bowazon and
Javazon) don\'t need much resists and defensive mods, and are Hell
viable even for starters.

Bowazon and Javazon now have elemental skills of all four kinds which
synergize each other. One of Act 2 mercenaries uses Conviction. Abundant
Conviction and Lower Resist items are also available. Strafe Zons and
Multishot Zons also benefit from the abundant Amplify Damage items, and
improved Inner Sight.

Melee Amazon builds are more challenging, but Hell viable once you can
access decent gear. All melee skills except Jab can be used with any
melee weapon, which greatly enlarges the option of available weapons.
The best news for melee Amazons would be the improvement of D/A/E
skills. They work much faster with melee weapons (especially with 2H
weapons), and also grant Defense bonus.
