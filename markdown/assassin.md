## General {#top}

### Overview
Basically all popular Assassin builds in LoD also work fine in ES.
Claw Mastery is changed to Melee Mastery, and some skills like Tiger
Strike and Phoenix Strike work with any weapons. So you may like to
try a weapon other than Claws.

The new Assassin weapon Katana has a limited use because of being a 2H
sword, but looks cool and the damage is awesome. Iaigiri (a Concentrate
like skill) is very defensive and popular among Katana sins. Oskill
Whirlwind and oskill Zeal are also recommended for most weapons
including Katana and Claws. Shuriken is a ranged skill that shoots
throwing knives like Strafe, which is also good as a subskill for
MA/Trap builds to activate a CtC curse.

Trapper is one of the best builds for beginners, because it benefits
from Skill Tab Reroll and Skill Tab Forging a lot. Weaker fire traps are
improved or replaced with a magic damage trap. Death Sentry is
\*nerfed\*, but it doesn\'t matter after all because abundant curse/aura
items and Conviction mercenary greatly increase the total trap damage.
