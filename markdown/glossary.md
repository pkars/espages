#### AD

-   [Amplify Damage](class/necromancer.html#amplify-damage)
-   [Ancient Decipherer][]

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Ancient Decipherer

A cubing material to decipher (identify) an [Ancient Scroll][].
Also called Decipherer or AD. 8 Ancient Decipherers makes a Dragon
Stone. (Say a dime if a Dragon Stone is a dollar.) Ancient Decipherers
are also often used in cheap cube recipes.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Ancient Scroll

A cubing Material used for Secret Recipes. There exist 50 Secret Recipes
and 50 Ancient Scrolls, and each recipe requires corresponding scroll.
Ancient Scrolls need to be deciphererd before using. (See [Ancient Decipherer][].)

You need to cube the scroll, but it\'s refunded after cubing, so you
need only one scroll of each number. You can reroll a new scroll from
the redundant scrolls. You can also save the redundant ones for trading
or convert them into a Dragon Stone.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Anvil Stone

Anvil Stones are cubing materials used for Forging. They are made from
\"4 Dragon Stones + 1 Perfect Gem\", and never dropped by monsters.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Aura Stone

Aura Stones are cubing materials used for Aura Forging. Aura Forging
adds an aura to an amulet. There exist 7 kinds of Aura Stones, which are
made from the highest Unique Class Amulets of 7 classes.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Automod

Automods are the new feature added in D2 Expansion. Similar to [staffmods](#staffmod),
but adds other properties than individual skill bonus. The all resist
bonus on Paladin shields and the bow skilltab bonus on Amazon bows are
the automods, for example. Unique items and set items can\'t have
automods.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### C
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Cast Delay

Some spells can\'t be cast for a specific period after you cast that
spell. This is a restriction to prohibit spamming that spell, mainly to
avoid the graphic lag. Also known as Casting Deley, Cast Timer, Spell
Timer, etc. See also [Next Delay][].

Some times it seems you can cast these skills without delay, two meteors
in a row, for example. But one of them is a fake which is displayed only
at the client side, and has no actual effect.

In ES, Cast Delays are generally eased. But when you play multiplayer
games, please keep it in mind that these skills may cause a heavy lag
for other players.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Charged Skills

-   Charged Skills are handy in ES, because the repair cost is very
    cheap and they generally have more charges than LoD ones.
-   How can I boost Charged Skills?
    -   Any kinds of skill bonuses DON\'T increase the skill level.
    -   The hard points in your skills synergize the charged skill.
    -   *Elemental Masteries* and *+X% To Elemental Skill Damage* mods
        increase the Charged Skill\'s damage.
-   See also [Marrowwalk Bug](#h8c78068).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Crystal

Crystals are new items that are used to cube Uber Organs and Kanji
Runes. They are found in Ores which serve as a container for them.
Crystals are extracted by cubing the ore with itself. More information
[here](playing-tips.html#re2a1259).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Crystal Can

The Crystal Can is one of the stockers, which can be purchased from
Gheed. It stores crystals and keeps them organized. Crystals are stored
as a number of points and may be extracted in chipped quality (1 point)
and normal quality (100 points) by using the Can Opener (also available
from Gheed). More information [here](playing-tips.html#re2a1259).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### CtC Spell

See [Procing Spell][].

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### D
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### D-Stone

-   abbreviation for [Dragon Stone][]
-   for the verb, see [D-Stoning][]

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### D-Stoning

D-Stoning is enhancing an item through the use of [Dragon Stones][dragon stone]
and other cubing materials. D-stoning recipies add beneficial modifiers
to the item, and also adds +2-4 (2 for weapons, 3 for body
armor/helms/shields, 4 for other gears) to the item\'s level
requirement. [D-stoning recipies](http://esdb.d2se.org/es3cube_n.htm#dst)
can be found at the ES Database.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Devil\'s Food {#devils-food}

![invdevils.gif](../img/invdevils.gif){.size-28}\

Devil\'s Foods are the trigger item to cause the [World Event][]
in ES. In LoD, the trigger item is Stones of Jordan, and in the older
versions of ES, The One Rings. Devil\'s Foods can be made of any Unique
Rings and Amulets via Rerolling Orb, and much cheaper than these rarest
Unique Rings. ([Diablo Clone][] is toned down in ES, both in life and drop,
so a cheaper trigger item is used.)

Selling an SOJ or One Ring doesn\'t always trigger the World Event, but
selling a Devil\'s Food always does. (The World Event doesn\'t occur in
Mac version.)

-   You can make a Devil\'s Food from 5 Devil\'s Food points stored in
    Rerollng Orb.
    -   Level 10 Unique Ring/Amulet: 1 Devil\'s Food point
    -   Level 20 Unique Ring/Amulet: 2 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 30 Unique Ring/Amulet: 3 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 40 Unique Ring/Amulet: 4 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 50 Unique Ring/Amulet: 5 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 60 Unique Ring/Amulet: 6 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 75 Unique Ring/Amulet: 7 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 45 Class Unique Ring/Amulet: 3 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 60 Class Unique Ring/Amulet: 5 Devil\'s Food points
    -   Level 75 Class Unique Ring/Amulet: 7 Devil\'s Food points

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Diablo Clone

Diablo Clone (AKA Uber Diablo) is the special monster spawned in the
[World Event](#world_event). He looks like green colored Diablo
and uses the same attacks and spells, but is much stronger.

Diablo Clone\'s life is fairly reduced in ES, though, which is because
his huge life can cause rollover in high players setting and results
one-hit kill.

He always drops an Annihilus Unique Charm in LoD. In ES, he has 10%
chance to drop a random Unique Charm, 30% chance to drop a rare charm
and 60% chance to drop a magic charm. (The size of the charm is random.)

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Diminishing Return

It generally means the output per input which decreases as the input
increases.

For example, the resist bonus of Natural Resistance is a typical
diminishing return. It increases by 9% when the slvl increases from 1 to
2, but increases by 7% when the slvl increases from 2 to 3. And in
higher slvls, it needs several slvls to attain the next value.

In Diablo II, following formula is used to determine a diminishing
return value from the skill level, min and max (internal values).

    ((110*level) * (max-min))/(100 * (level+6)) + min

-   The value at slvl 1 is always slightly higher than the \"min\".
-   The value reaches \"max\" at slvl 60.

In the skill pages of this Wiki, the important diminishing return values
are fully listed. (Even 1% skill IAS of Fanaticism and Annihilation can
affect the IAS breakpoint, for example.)

The less important diminishing return values are listed like
\"diminishing return (10-100)\", which means it starts at slightly more
than 10, and is capped at 100 at slvl 60.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Dragon Stone

Dragon Stones are cubing materials dropped by monsters in every area of
the game. They are used for a large number of cube recipies, and are
also used for [d-stoning][] existing items.

Dragon Stones have seven differnt forms, each of which is mildly
associated with a specific class and gem type: Dragon Stone
(Assassin/Ruby), Holy Symbol (Paladin/Diamond), Blackmoor
(Necromancer/Skull), Forging Hammer (Barbarian/Amethyst), Crushed Gem
(Sorceress/Sapphire), Spider\'s Silk (Amazon/Emerald), and Tyranium Ore
(Druid/Topaz).

Any form of Dragon Stone can be transformed into the others via
right-click.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### DualMax Weapon {#dualmax}

A DualMax weapon is a rare weapon with both Screaming ((3/clvl) +3-300%
Enhanced Max Damage)and Fool\'s ((2.5/clvl) +2-250 To Max Damage) mods.
Unlike straight Enhanced Damage %, these properties cannot be dstoned,
hence items that have both mods are considered very valuable. The word
\'DualMax\' was coined by Goeido, and he is the rightful copyright
owner. ![:)](../img/smile.png)

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### E
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### EIAS

EIAS is an abbreviation for \'effective increased attack speed\'. IAS
granted by items is subject to diminishing returns, and is converted
into EIAS in the game using a diminshing return formula. Skill-based IAS
and [weapon speed modifiers](#wsm)
are not subject to dimishing returns, which can make it possible to
reach attack speeds unatainable with item IAS.

Using the following table, you can find out how much effective IAS you
gain from items. If you then subtract the [WSM][]
and add the amount of IAS gained from skills, you will have your total
effective IAS, which can be compared with an EIAS breakpoints table for
the skill you are using to tell you your effective attack speed.

#### Fire Skills

The term **Fire Skill** in **+X to Fire Skill Levels** (the mod on
Magefists, etc.) means the skills that deal fire damage, and includes
following skills.

**Amazon**: Fire Strike, Pyre Javelin, Fire Wall, Immolation Arrow,
Exploding Arrow\
**Assassin**: Fist of Fire, Dragon Tail, Lava Sentry, Steam Sentry\
**Druid**: Volcano, Moltem Boulder, Firestorm, Fire Claws, Volcanic
Creeper\
**Paladin**: Holy Fire\
**Necromancer**: Fire Golem, Hydra, Corpse Explosion\
**Sorceress**: All skills in Fire Spell tree except Fanatic Swing and
Fire Mastery

Note: Dragon Tail and Corpse Explosion are included although most people
don\'t think they are fire skills.

Note: Protection From Fire and Fire Mastery aren\'t included because
they deal no fire damage.

Note: Vengence isn\'t included because it deals fire damage in a special
way. This is the only exception.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Forging

Forging is an item enhancement frequently used as well as D-Stoning.
Forging adds much better bonus than D-Stoning and no penalty, but you
can apply Forging only once per item. You can remove the applied Forging
from the item to apply another Forging. Most part of the materials are
refunded.

Also see [Forging (Item
Enhancement)](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020204723/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#g31f5de2).

#### Gem Can

The Gem Can is one of the [stockers](#stocker),
which can be purchased from Gheed. It stores gems for future use, and
helps keep them organized. Gems are stored as a number of points,
corresponding to how many chipped gems it would take to cube them, and
may be extracted in any quality (if sufficient points exist) using the
Can Opener (also available from Gheed).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### HFD

Half Freeze Duration.

-   HFD doesn\'t stack. More than one HFD is meaningless.
-   Cold Resistance also reduces Freeze Duration, and HFD works with
    Cold Resistance.\
    (ex. 75% Cold Resist cuts Freeze Duration down to 25%, and HFD cuts
    it down to 12.5%.)

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### HoD Run

HoD is an abbreviation of Halls of the Dead, in Dry Hills, Act 2. The
super unique Pantherwoman nearby the Horadric Cube chest drops a Forging
Hammer (50% chance in Normal, 75% chance in NM and 100% chance in Hell).
Killing her repeatedly is an effective way to collect Dragon Stones, and
called HoD Runs.

According to a bug report, the chest room can be generated without the
unique Pantherwoman in some very rare cases. In such cases, you will
need to enable the map regeneration so that D2 generates a new valid
map.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### J
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Jewelry

Jewelry may be a confusing word for non English speaking people. Jewelry
usually means the accessories with jewels, not the jewels themselves. So
[Jewelry means Rings and Amulets]{.ul} in D2, and Jewels are not
Jewelry. Jewelry is an uncountable noun and cannot be used in plural.
(\"Jewelries\" is wrong.)

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### K
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Kanji Rune

[Kanji Runes](playing-tips.html#o6232ff2)
are the highest 14 runes which use Chinese characters. They can\'t be
dropped by monsters, but can be cubed from a [Null Rune][] and [crystals](#crystal).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Knuckle

Knuckles are the new weapon class added in patch R3D, which use the
bare-handed attack animation. They have a very short range, but the
animation speed of the bare-handed attack is pretty fast. 2H knuckles
also exists.

Knuckle class weapons have the properties of blunt weapons and claws at
once. They have the blunt weapon\'s \"+50% Damage to Undeads\" bonus.
Assassins can dual-wield 1H knuckles (or a 1H knuckle and a claw), and
use the claw only skills with knuckle(s).

-   1H knuckles: Brass Knuckle - Tekko (exc.) - Raging Knuckle (eli)
-   2H knuckles: Battering Arm - Rock Buster (exc.) - Wrecking Arm (eli)

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### L
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Light Radius

This mod makes your sight blighter and yourself more noticeable for
monsters. If the value is negative, your sight gets darker and yourself
gets less noticeable. Giving a negative Light Radius to melee
mercenaries makes them less aggressive and live long.

Light Radius on an item is capped at +11 and lower capped at -5.
According to the Arreat Summit, more than +5 Light Radius is meaningless
because the default Light Radius is 13 yard and the possible Light
Radius in the game is 18 yard. Even if this description is true, I
believe it works up to +8 Light Radius because all radii are internally
multiplied by 2/3 in D2 (i.e. +1 radius stands for +2/3 yard).

#### Marrowwalk Bug {#h8c78068}

-   The slvl of a Charged Skill is counted as hard points and synergizes
    other skills as long as you put no hard point in that skill.
-   This is a bug of LoD 1.10 and called Marrowwalk Bug after the unique
    boots that have Level 33 Bone Prison charge.
-   In ES, this bug is treated as a feature, and several items are
    intentionally given Charged Skills as a synergy bonus.
-   Examples of Charged Skills that are useful as a synergy:
    -   Discontent (Runeword): Lvl 20 Shadow Master -\> Shadow Warrior
    -   France (Gemword): Level 8 Slow Missiles -\> Inner Sight
    -   Protection Circuit (Unique Wrecking Arm): Level 40 Meteor -\>
        Fire Ball, etc.
    -   Protection Circuit (Unique Wrecking Arm): Level 30 Teleport -\>
        Oskill Energy Shield
    -   Marrow Walk (LoD Unique Boneweave Boots): Level 33 Bone Prison
        -\> Bone Spirits, etc.
    -   STONE (LoD Runeword): Level 16 Molten Boulder -\> Volcanic
        Creeper, etc.

#### Mod

-   Abbreviation for Modification (of a PC game). Eastern Sun is one of
    the Mods of Diablo II.
-   To make a Mod. (ex. Modding, a Modder, heavily Modded, etc.)
-   Magic modifier, AKA property or magic property, the magic bonus on
    items, like life, strength and enhanced damage. Similar to Affixes
    (Prefixes and Suffixes), but Affixes are the groups of mods
    gererated on Magic Items and Rare Items. An Affix can have multiple
    mods (ex. **King\'s** has two mods, Enhanced Damage and AR bonus).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Monster Level

-   Monster Level (mlvl) is the level of monsters just like Character
    Level (clvl) is the level of player characters and hirelings.

-   **Non-Boss Monsters in Normal:** Each monster has the predefined
    mlvl. Mlvl 1 for LoD Quill Rats and mlvl 2 for ES Quill Rats, for
    example.

-   **Non-Boss Monsters in NM and Hell:** Each monster has the same mlvl
    as the area\'s level where it is spawned. (Before LoD 1.10, each
    monster has the predefined mlvl.)

-   **Champions:** 2 levels higher than the non-boss monsters.

-   **Unique Monsters [and their Minions]{.ul}:** 3 levels higher than
    the non-boss monsters. As an expection, some Super Uniques are
    treated like Act Bosses.

-   **Act Bosses and Semi Bosses**

-   **In Combat:** Not only the Attack Rate and Defense, but also the
    mlvl/clvl of the attacker and defender determine the chance to hit.

        Chance to Hit: 100 * AR / (AR + DR) * 2 * alvl / (alvl + dlvl)

        AR = Attack Rating; DR = Defense Rating; alvl = Level of Attacker; dlvl = Level of Defender.

    The difference of mlvl/clvl matters less for casters because magic
    spells automatically hit. But it still increases the chance for
    monsters to hit you.

-   **Item Drop:** If a monster drops an item, its Item Level (ilvl) is
    equal to the mlvl of the monster (capped at 99.)
    -   Affixes on magic and rare items are determined by the ilvl. The
        alvl of available affixes and the ilvl aren\'t always the same.
        See [Ilvl
        Calculator](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020204723/http://hpcgi3.nifty.com/miyoshino/d2/ilvl.cgi).
    -   Unique and Set items have its own level, 10 for [Fallen Star](http://esdb.d2se.org/es3uarmo_n.htm)
        for example. If the mlvl is less than the level of a unique/set
        item, that monster can\'t drop that item.
    -   The base item isn\'t determined by the mlvl, but by the
        TreasureClass (TC.)

#### Naraku

-   Naraku is the dungeon under Ancients Way in Act 5. Naraku is a
    Japanese word borrowed from Sanskrit, which means Hell or Abyss, and
    the area is populated with [Japan-themed
    monsters](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020204723/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ChangesInR4A#rdeff9d0).
-   Naraku consists of 3 levels and leads to the deeper levels including
    Nihlathak\'s Domain, the toughest area in the game.

#### Next Delay

Next Delay is an internal parameter of skills like [Cast Delay][].
If a skill with Next Delay damages an enemy, it doesn\'t take more
damage from that skill for a specific period. For example, Shock Web has
a Next Delay of 25 frames (1 second).

#### Null Rune

[Null Rune](playing-tips.html#o6232ff2) is needed to cube [Kanji runes][kanji rune].
It can be dropped or made from Wo Rune + Full Rejuv pot but it cannot be
downgraded to Wo. It can be stored in Rune Stocker.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### O
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Ore

Ores serve as containers for [crystals](#crystal).
All monsters have a chance to drop an ore, but some bosses have a better
chance to drop an ore with particular crystals. An ore first needs to be
identified in town or with a Scroll of Identify, and then cubed with
itself to extract crystals. Once all crystals are extracted, an ore has
no further use. More information [here](playing-tips.html#re2a1259).

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Organ

Organs are cubing materials dropped by monsters. Specific monsters have
roughly 1/100 \~ 1/200 chance to drop a specific organ. Used for
[Tinkering] and other recipes. Also known as \"monsters\' body parts\".

-   Hearts
    -   (Dropped by Fallens, Bigheads, Rogues, Maggots, Scarabs,
        Gargoyles, Swamp Dwellers, Evil Mothers, Siege Beasts, Blood
        Lords, Putrid Defilers, Succubi, Succubus Witches, Black
        Knights, Over Lords, Barbarians)
-   Souls
    -   (Dropped by Skeletons, Skeleton Mages, Zombies, Wraiths,
        Goatmen, Lesser Mummies, Greater Mummies, Hiddens, Undead
        Fetishes, Rot Walkers)
-   Fangs
    -   (Dropped by Orcish Soldiers, Vipers, Spiders, Baal\'s Minion)
-   Sculps
    -   (Dropped by Brutes, Ghoul Lords, Pinheads, Dome Knights,
        Sinister Knights)
-   Tails
    -   (Dropped by Foul Crows, Sabre Cats, Slingers)
-   Quills
    -   (Dropped by Quill Rats, Quill Bears, Thorned Hulks, Death
        Maulers)
-   Brains
    -   (Dropped by Fetishes, Sand Leapers, Imps)
-   Jaw Bones
    -   (Dropped by Skeleton Archers, Rogue Archers)
-   Spleens
    -   (Dropped by Zealots, Corpse Spitters, Over Seers)
-   Eyes
    -   (Dropped by Zakarum Priests, Finger Mages, Golems)
-   Horns
    -   (Dropped by Pit Lords, Rhynos, Blowpipe Fetishes)

The following materials are NOT organs:

-   Flags
    -   (Dropped by Fallen Shamans, Fetish Shamans)
-   Steaks
    -   (Dropped by Cows)
-   Cookbooks
    -   (Extremely rare drops by Succubus Witches)
-   Player\'s Ears
    -   (Can be obtained by launching 2 instances of ES and killing a
        dummy character in a TCP/IP game)

#### Oskill

Oskill means the skill point bonus that works for any character classes.
\"O\" isn\'t the number zero, but is the letter \"O\". There have been
made several assumpitions what \"O\" means, an abbreviation of
\"off-class skill\" for example, but the Arreat Summit doesn\'t refer to
its derivation.

\"+X to All Skill Levels\" bonus can increase the skill level of an
oskill, but the class specific bonuses like \"+X to Sorceress Skill
Levels\" can\'t. Therefore, All Skill bonus is more precious than Class
Skill bonus, especially in ES, where various oskill items are available.

[Recently it proved the individual skill bonuses like \"+X to Fire Ball
(Sorceress Only)\" also **WORK** for other classes as long as the
character has the oskill of that skill.]{.ul}

Oskill bonus is capped at 3 for the original class it belongs to.
According to the Arreat Summit, this is an intentional limitation. It
can be confusing that this limitation is not per item but per character.
For example, if a Barbarian equips three items with oskill BO, the cap
is not 9 but still 3.

In LoD, rares are no match for uniques, sets and runeworded items. But
sometimes rares can be indeed godly in ES, thanks to the suffixes of
useful oskills and auras.

Oskill suffixes (of Skill Master) are found at [Suffixes](http://esdb.d2se.org/es3suff_n.htm)

-   This mod stops the life regeneration of the monster.
-   This mod doesn\'t prevent the heal ability of monsters (ex.
    Councils\' healing themselves and Zakarum Priests\' healing minions).
-   You need to physically hit the target. This mod doesn\'t work with damage spells.
-   This mod doesn\'t work when equipped by a mercenary.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Procing Spell

Procing Spells are spells that are triggered when you are hit by a
monster or when you hit/attack a monster. \"6% Chance to Cast Level 5
Fire Ball On Striking\", for example. Also known as CtC spells (CtC is
an abbreviation of \"Chance to Cast\").

-   **On Striking**: Works only when you actually hit a monster. Works
    for both melee and ranged attacks.
-   **On Attack**: Works when you swing a weapon, even if you miss the
    monster. But doesn\'t work for ranged attacks.
-   **When Struck**: Works when you are struck by a monster.
-   As an exception, *On Striking* and *On Attack* mods don\'t work with
    Whirlwind and Dance of Death. *When Struck* mod works though, and is
    a viable option for WW/DoD builds.
-   When Struck mods aren\'t so good when you have too good defense (ie.
    Concentrate Barbs and Iaigiri Sins).
-   Procing Spells aren\'t affected by any skill bonuses. But are
    affected by the synergies, Elemental masteries and +XX% to Elemental
    Skill Damage mods.

CtC suffixes (of Fire Ball, etc.) are found at [Suffixes](http://esdb.d2se.org/es3suff_n.htm)

### R
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Reroll

Transmuting junk items into a new item, like cubing 3 Magic Rings into a
Magic Amulet in the original D2. The name comes from \"rolling the dice again\".

There are many reroll recipes in ES, and you can reroll magic rings into
rares and rares into uniques, for example. All junk rings, amulets,
jewels and charms are generally worth picking up in ES (unless you are super rich).

You can of course reroll as soon as you get 3 or 7 junks, which would be
helpful especially when you play untwinked. But the ilvl of the output
depends on the character level, so you may like to reserve most of the
junks for the future. Rerolling Orb can store such junks as rerolling
points and prevents your stash from being messed up.

[Back to top](#top){.totop}


### S
[Back to top](#top){.totop}


#### Staffmod

Staffmods are the random bonus to individual skills on specific items.
Staves are spawned with Sorceress\' staffmods, for example. Unique items
and set items can\'t have staffmods. A staffmod adds +1-3 To a skill,
and an item can have up to 3 staffmods. In ES, staffmods are a bit
screwed up, to avoid another more important problem. Please see these
two [FAQ](es-faq.html#n0fac7d9)s for details.

#### Stocker

Stockers are the items to store multiple items in 1x1 space. They are
implemented for Mac users who can\'t use the multiple stash of PlugY,
but also useful for Windows users. Also useful for trading dozens of
gems, etc.\
Stockers can be purchased from Gheed.

-   [Gem Can][]: Stores gems.
-   [Crystal Can][]: Stores crystals.
-   [Multi-Stocker][]: Stores Dragon Stones, Organs and many other misc items.
-   Rune/Decal Stocker: Stores Runes and Ancient Decals. To store a LoD
    rune, cube it to separate it into an ES rune and a Decal.
-   Tome of Ancient Scrolls: Stores Ancient Scrolls.
-   Rerolling Orb: Stores Rings/Amulets/Jewels/Charms/Quivers for
    rerolling.

playing term are determined in advance. The host player opens a
dedicated thread in the forum. The participants declare their entry
there, and report their score and stats by updating the character table.

#### Uber Organs

[Uber Organs](playing-tips.html#mc05cb2d) are used in certain [tinkering recipes](http://esdb.d2se.org/es3cube_n.htm#tin).
They can\'t be dropped by monsters. They are cubed from [crystals](#crystal) instead.

#### Unique Stone

Unique Stones are the cubing materials Anya gives as the reward of
rescuing her. You can make a unique item by a Unique Stone and a no
socket white weapon or armor. Like Charsi\'s imbue, superior and
low-quality items can also be used, but unlike imbue, ethereality is
gone.

There are three grades of Unique Stones, (nor), (exc) and (eli), and
they make normal, exceptional and elite uniques respectively.

[If your character\'s level is enough high, she gives an exceptional one
in NM and an elite one in Hell. Otherwise, she gives a normal one.]{.ul}
You can see the condition [here](tables.html#n7fdda65).

#### Untwinked

Twinking is giving a low-level character items found or created by a
high-level character, in order to beef them up. Playing untwinked means
restricting yourself to using items found by your character, without
trading or twinking, and without using any items from the shared stash.

#### Vanilla

\"Vanilla LoD\" means the original LoD with no MOD installed. This is
the association of the plain ice-cream with no special flavor being
called \"vanilla ice-cream\". The original LoD is also called as \"Plain
LoD\", \"Unmodded Game\", etc.

#### World Event

The realm (Battle Net) only event implemented in the first season of LoD
1.10 Ladder. Randomly the message \"Diablo walks on earth\" is displayed
with an earthquake, and the first super unique monster you encounter
turns into the [Diablo Clone][].

Selling the trigger item (SOJ in LoD, and [Devil\'s Food](#devils-food)
in ES) makes the event happen sooner.

Though this is the realm only event, the utility plugin PlugY emulates
this event in single games in ES. This event doesn\'t occur in Mac
version, which doesn\'t have PlugY.

#### WSM

Weapon Speed Modifiers affect the speed at which a weapon can attack.
After applying diminishing returns to your item-based IAS, the WSM is
subtracted from your [EIAS][].
A positive WSM can therefore make much larger amounts of IAS necessary
to reach a high attack rate, while a negative WSM can greatly reduce
your need for IAS. Typically, weapons with high WSMs have higher damage
per attack to make up for their slower attack rate, while faster low-WSM
weapons do less damage.

Since skill-based IAS is not subject to diminishing returns, it is
possible to make up for a low WSM weapon by using a skill that grants
IAS.

You can find the WSMs of all weapons in ES on the [weapons page](http://esdb.d2se.org/es3weap_n.htm)
at the ES database.
