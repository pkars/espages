#### Dragon Claw

Required Level
:   1

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Improved damage.

Notes
:   Dragon Claw is the only attack skill that requires dual claw. DC
    consists of two swings, and the fastest speed is 10 frames (5 frames
    per swing). This isn\'t bad as it sounds, because so-called 4 frame
    zeal (the fastest zeal) has the ending animation and the average
    speed is roughly 4.8 frame per swing. The fastest DC is nearly as
    fast as the fastest Zeal and has better damage bonus.

:   The most popular usage of DC is finisher, the skill to release
charge-ups. The skill description reads DC releases the charge twice,
but it actually does only once. Even the fastest DC requires 10 frames
to release a charge, while single action attack (normal attack/Iaigiri)
requires only 7 frames. If you like to release charges as fast as
possible, a single action attack would be better. But you can also think
like this: DC let you land another physical blow (with good ED) in only
3 frame. After all, using DC as the finisher isn\'t so bad, especially
when you equip a 1H weapon (ie. the only single attack you can use is
normal attack.)

:   Another usage is the main attack skill. As stated above, DC is as good
as Zeal. A pure DC build (using only DC) is possible, and can be better
than using charge-up skills in some cases, say with tons of Crushing
Blow and/or CtC Static. Like Zealots, pure DC builds may lack AoE (ie.
weak against a large mob). 1 point in Death Sentry will make up for the
lack of AoE well.

Pros
:   Fast attack. Triggers CtC spells frequently.

Cons
:   Requires dual claw. Release only one charge per two swings.

#### Dragon Tail

Required Level
:   18

Prerequisites
:   *Dragon Talon (1)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Improved AR bonus. Increased mana cost.

Pros
:   Converts the damage of a single target skill to AoE damage.

Cons
:   Fire immune monsters won\'t take the added fire damage. Physical
    immune monsters won\'t take physical damage, meaning no fire damage
    will be done either. It\'s kind of like a 2 and a half weakness. You
    can use the melee damage to kill fire immunes, but physical
    immunes(that can\'t be broken) will never be affected.

Notes
:   Fire damage is based on physical damage done by the kick, good boots
    are the key to this skill. dragon tail also gives synergy to fire
    fist claws of thunder and blades of ice, and posibly other charge
    ups

:   *Fists of Fire (6)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Improved synergies.

    of claws of thunder. the nova moves faster and will be what hits the
    monsters around you wile the charged bolts will spread out slightly
    past the edges of the screen.

#### Shuriken

Required Level
:   30

Prerequisites
:   *None*

A new ES skill
:   Shuriken is a throwing version of Strafe, which requires a throwing
    knife to use. because it is restricted to 1 hand weapons and
    throwing knives are lower damage then most other throwing weapons
    suriken does not have the 3/4 weapon damage penalty strafe does

Pros
:   Fast attack. Also good as a subskill for trappers to trigger CtC
    Lower Resist, and to pass the time after laying the maximum number
    of traps.

Cons

Notes
:   shuriken will always throw its minimum number of knives unless ther
    are no targets in range. at 10 minimum,that might mean 10 knives at
    one target or 5 each at 2 targets.\
    Shares many of its synergies with iaigiri and all of them with
    dragon blade.\
    In the following table, the \"roughly 2% damage per level\" note is
    based on research done by one user; the damage of this skill is
    highly dependent on several factors, including bonuses from Passive
    skills (the Barbarian Throwing Mastery as well as Assassin
    passives).

#### Phoenix Strike

Required Level
:   30

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Improved explosion radius, damage (especiallly cold damage) and
    synergies.

Pros

    skills. Somewhat unwieldy unless you only want to use the 3rd
    charge.
