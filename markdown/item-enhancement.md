#### Max Socket Number Limitation by ilvl [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#c8d2a8b4 "c8d2a8b4"){#c8d2a8b4 .anchor_super} {#content_1_2}

-   The ilvl of the target item also limits the max socket number of an
    item, as well as the max socket number in the database base item
    page.
-   MaxSock1 is the max socket number when \"ilvl \< 25\". MaxSock25 is
    the max socket number when \"25 \<= ilvl \< 40\". MaxSock40 is the
    max socket number when \"40 \<= ilvl\".

#### Larzuk\'s Quest Reward [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#q6610142 "q6610142"){#q6610142 .anchor_super} {#content_1_3}

-   **White (Normal/Superior/Low Quality) Weapons and Armor:** Larzuk
    makes the maximum number of sockets allowed on the base item, as
    long as the item level is equal to or higher than 40. As a rule of
    thumb, the items dropped in Nightmare Act 3 and later can have the
    maximum sockets.
-   **Magic Weapons and Armor:** Larzuk makes one or two sockets
    randomly. Because you can make up to 3 sockets on a magic item by a
    cube recipe in ES, it\'s a bad idea to ask Larzuk to make sockets on
    magic items.
-   **Other Weapons and Armor (Rare, Crafted, Set and Unique):** Larzuk
    always makes one socket. Because you can make up to 2 sockets on
    rare weapons, helms, body armor and shields by a cube recipe in ES,
    it\'s a bad idea to ask Larzuk to make sockets on these rare items.
-   The socketing recipes cost higher for upper items, so it\'s most
    efficient to ask Larzuk to make sockets on Elite items, if possible.
    But you don\'t have to stick to this principle too much, because the
    difference of the costs can be insignificant in end games, and
    Larzuk\'s reward has some restrictions as stated above.

#### Socketing Recipes [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#fc8fe032 "fc8fe032"){#fc8fe032 .anchor_super} {#content_1_4}

-   **Magic Weapons and Armor:** The recipe makes up to 3 sockets. Of
    course the socket number is capped at the maximum socket number of
    the base item.
-   **Rare Weapons, Helms, Body Armor and Shields:** The recipe makes up
    to 2 sockets.
-   **Rare Gloves, Belts and Boots:** The recipe makes only 1 socket.
-   **Crafted/Set/Unique Weapons and Armor:** The recipe makes only 1
    socket.
-   **White Weapons and Armor:** The recipe can make any number of
    sockets.
-   Non Secret recipes rerolls the white items, which means all
    Ethereality, Superiority and Low Quality are removed. Staffmods are
    also removed/rerolled. Don\'t use the non-secret recipe to socket
    that +3 Frozen Orb / +3 Blizzard / +3 Cold Mastery staff you just
    found.
-   Secret recipe 16 and 17 make sockets without removing these
    properties. Of course it\'s better to use non secret recipes for Low
    Quality items. Superiority is always welcome because the repair cost
    of Superior items is very low in ES.
-   You can make a Socket Donut from a Unique Dagger, if the gold is
    more precious than the time (ie. \"if you are poor\"). You can
    gamble a Unique Dagger cheaply with a level 1 character.
-   The socketing cost is generally cheaper, so it\'s one of the most
    frequently used enhancements even in early and mid games.

-   Secret Recipe 12, 13, 41-48 can make a socket on these items. Charms
    generally get bigger if they have a sockets.
-   Unique Amulets and Rings of LoD (cubed from Ancient Coupons) are
    spawned with a socket.
-   Legacy (LoD) Crafted Amulets and Rings are spawned with a socket.

-   Forging adds skill bonus or some other good bonus without any
    penalty. But one item can have only one Forging mod at once.
-   Please imagine an invisible socket besides the conventional sockets,
    and you can put a bonus there.
-   Forging can be removed later, to apply another Forging. Most of the
    Forging materials are refunded at that time.

-   Adds +1 To Class Skill Levels. (+1 To Amazon Skill Levels, etc.)
-   The skill levels are very important, especially for casters, but
    also for melee characters. Other enhancements like D-Stoning can\'t
    add a Skill bonus, so why do you use the precious Forging room for
    other bonuses?
-   All Skill Forging (Secret Recipe 40) adds +1 To All Skill Levels.
    This is very expensive, but can boost oskills and mercenary\'s
    skills.

-   Adds some bonus like Max Life and Enhanced Damage, four times as
    much as a D-Stoning.
-   Skill Forging is generally prefered, but Stat Forgings are also used
    if there is some reason. For example, the damage of Multiple Shot
    doesn\'t increase with the skill level, so Multiple Shot Zons will
    prefer Enhanced Damage to Skill Bonus. Or a character may need more
    Life than more skill levels, and have no room for D-Stoning Life.
-   Also, Stat Forging is often used for mercenary\'s equipment, because
    Skill Forging is useless for mercenaries and All Skill Forging is
    very expensive.

-   Adds the properties of the runes to the item.
-   As stated in Stat Forging, Skill Forging is generally prefered. But
    Rune Forging with low runes is cheap and useful for early games.
    (ex. Instead of making a socket and putting a Ka (=Nef) rune, you
    can apply Ka Forging, which is cheap and handy.)
-   Some properties like Cannot Be Frozen and Ignore Target\'s Defense
    can only be added by Rune Forging.
-   If you have an ultimate ethereal item and like to add Indestructible
    to it, \"Wo (=Zod) Rune Forging + Skill Forged Unique Jewel\" is
    better than \"Skill Forging + Wo Rune\". Wo Rune Forging costs 2 Wo
    Runes, but is worth considering because getting 2 Wo runes ISN\'T
    impossible in ES.

-   Adds Skill Tab Bonus to a magic or rare jewel.
-   Why can\'t you apply Skill Forging to magic and rare jewels which
    seem weaker than Unique ones? It\'s because rare jewels can have a
    Skill Bonus, and magic jewels can have an All Skill Bonus as a
    prefix. If you can apply Skill Forging to magic and rare jewels, you
    can have +2 skill bonus on a jewel, which is too strong.

-   Adds 2/3 of the properties of the runes to a magic or a rare jewel.
-   You can select which properties are applied, weapon mods or helm
    mods.
-   Some properties like Knockback and Cannot Be Frozen can\'t be
    divided and fully work.
-   2/3 Rune Forging is cheap and handy. If you\'re planning to socket a
    Ka (=Nef) rune to a bow, why don\'t you apply 2/3 Ka Forging to the
    best jewel you have at that time?

### D-Stoning / Gem Melding [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#efc55f53 "efc55f53"){#efc55f53 .anchor_super} {#content_1_14}

-   To cube a Dragon Stone (D-Stone) or one of its alternatives with an
    item to enhance the item.
-   Gem melding is a kind of D-Stoning, with different materials and
    different effects.
-   [You can apply D-Stoning as many times as you wish, but it adds a
    level rquirement penaly.]{.ul}
-   You can apply D-Stoning to any equipment (Weapons, Armor, Amulets
    and Rings). You can\'t apply D-Stoning to Charms, Jewels and
    Quivers.
-   You can add a key or a stamina pot to the recipe to select the added
    mod.
-   You can\'t remove D-Stonings from the items. But if the item is
    rerolled, applied D-Stonings are also canceled.
-   Each mod has its cap. (ex. 900% for Enhanced Damage, please see the
    next next section.) The mods added beyond the cap are ignored, and
    only the level requirement increases.
-   Secret Recipe 50 can remove the level requirement penalty by 1, but
    is rarely used because it\'s very expensive.
-   Lower level items aren\'t always weaker in ES, because lower level
    items can be applied D-Stoning more times. Before you apply base
    upgrade (normal -\> exc. or exc. -\> elite), you have to consider
    which is better, Defense from the upgrade or the room for D-Stoning.
    Base upgrade of Weapons and Body Armor are generally worth
    considering. But base upgrade of small pieces like gloves and belts
    increases less Defense, and is less attractive in ES.
-   The level requirement penalty is added to the requirement of the
    item itself or the socketables, whichever is the highest. For
    example, if you need to socket a req level 60 jewel, it makes no
    difference whether the level requirement of the item is 1 or 60. If
    you like to utilize the low level requirement (20) of Achilles set,
    you need to insert a socketable with req level 20 or less.
    Generally, it\'s effective to insert low req level socketables into
    low req level items, and high req level socketables into high req
    level items.
-   Gem Melding can be more effective than D-Stoning in many cases.
    D-Stoning strength will give you +4, Gem Melding an Perfect Amethyst
    into a helmet will give you +4 to strength and Damage Reduced By 1.
    If you need both Life and Mana leech, Gem Melding Perfect Skulls
    will give you +1 to Max Damage in addition to the same total amount
    of leech. Gem Melding Perfect Obsidians into the weapon will give
    you more +Enhanced Damage and Deadly Strike than D-Stoning both.
    Still, you may prefer to D-Stone +Enhanced Damage on the weapon and
    Deadly Strike on another item. Check the mods on Chipped Gems and
    compare them to the mods D-Stoning grants. The Helmet and Boots are
    especially good for Gem Melding as you can\'t Gem Meld the other
    items which use the Helmet Gem Type (Rings/Ammulet).

-   To cube a monster\'s organ with an item to enhance the item.
-   Unlike D-Stoning, Tinkering doesn\'t add any level requirement
    penalty. Instead, the Tinkering point is determined when an item is
    generated, and if you use up the Tinkering point you can\'t apply
    Tinkering any more.
-   Tinkering point varies betwen 15 and 25, and most Tinkering recipes
    consume 1 point, but some recipes consume more points.
-   You can\'t buy monster\'s organs, so you\'d better stock the organs
    as possible. But you don\'t have to scrimp too much, because you
    can\'t do Tinkering infinitely, and you\'ll get more organs than you
    need for the end game gears.

## D-stoning/Gem Melding Caps [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#bf7e4bac "bf7e4bac"){#bf7e4bac .anchor_super} {#content_1_17}

These are caps of the mods on an item. If you go over these caps, only
the level requirement is added for nothing. You can only go over capped
amount on an item if you socket it with Gem/Jewel/Rune that has that
mod. For example, you can go over 900% damage on a weapon if you socket
it with Wa rune. By the way, the caps are per item, so each socketable
can have 900% Enhanced Damage in theory.

Also, any mod on the item itself counts towards the cap. For example,
dwarven circlets have % Extra Gold From Monsters inherently, but it\'s
still not possible to go over the cap by that amount. The only exception
is set bonus.

## Life, Vit and Max Life bonuses [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#pafa61d7 "pafa61d7"){#pafa61d7 .anchor_super} {#content_1_18}

I don\'t have the formula handy, but based on how the specific life
bonuses are effected it seems the life formula is calculated like this:

(base life and any +life) \* ((100 + %max life)/100) + (VIT, VIT/lvl and
life/lvl) = total life

    base life = your life from stat points assigned into VIT
    +life = straight +X life bonus, like "+20 life"
    +%max life = like the item mod, and also includes skills like Wereforms, BO, Oak Sage.
    VIT = any vitality bonus from items
    VIT/lvl and life/lvl = well...level based life bonuses. 

So basically life and +%max life are combined, then whatever VIT and
life/vit per level is slapped on at the end. That means VIT and the
other 2 mods are NOT affected by Battle Orders and +%max life mods.

Which mod is better depends on the others. If you have low/no +% max
life for instance (such as Sorcs), the \"per clvl\" mods can usually
give a bigger bonus. If you have lots of life and +% max life (Barb with
huge Battle Orders), then straight life bonus is better since your BO
can turn +20 life into something like +50 life. My preferred choice is
to invest stat points heavily into VIT, then get lots and lots of +%max
life with +life sprinkled on top if I can spare it.

I would NOT recommend vitality D-stoning, EVER. 4 VIT is hardly
anything, I\'d go with +%max life instead every time.

(Energy, Energy/lvl and Mana/lvl have the same restriction.)

### Achilles\' Advantage Set [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#x0722b0e "x0722b0e"){#x0722b0e .anchor_super} {#content_1_20}

-   Base Items: Gauntlets, Plated Belt and Greaves
-   Level Requirement: 20
-   Character: Assuming a level 90 Paladin uses the set.

Though Achilles\'s set is a cheap low level set, it has a lot of useful
mods for melee characters, and is very handy because it frees up the
body armor and helm slot.\
The low level requirement allows a lot of D-Stoning, which makes this
set worth considering as the end-game equipment.

#### Forging [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#wee41243 "wee41243"){#wee41243 .anchor_super} {#content_1_21}

-   Forging is now removable (most of materials are refunded) while
    D-Stoning isn\'t. So Forging is suitable for enhancing temporary
    items. Even if you are planning to use the target item as your
    end-game gear, it would be better to apply Forging first, because
    you may change your mind.
-   If you use any oskills, the best Forging is All Skill Forging. But
    All Skill Forging is very expensive.
-   Usually Skill Forging is recommended for any classes, but Stat
    Forging is cheaper. If you have a limited amount of materials and
    often die, Stat Forging two items (Maximum Life +36%) can be more
    helpful than Skill Forging an item (Skill +1).
-   Skill Forging of a class doesn\'t help for mercenaries. All Skill
    Forging is very good for mercenaries, because it boosts their skill
    levels, especially the aura and warcries. Stat Forging is a cheap
    and good alternative for mercenaries until you become rich.
-   In this example, we are going to D-Stone Max Life, so we apply
    Paladin Skill Forging to all three pieces here.

Materials
:   (2 Anvil Stones, Chipped Diamond) x 3

Effect
:   +3 To Paladin Skill Levels

#### D-Stoning [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#j3dd9fdb "j3dd9fdb"){#j3dd9fdb .anchor_super} {#content_1_22}

-   Assuming the character level of the user is 90 and the required
    level of each piece is 20, you can add +70 level requirement penalty
    to each piece.
-   One D-Stoning adds +4 level requirement to Gloves, Belts and Boots.
-   70÷4=17, remainder 2. So you can apply D-Stoning 17 times per piece.
    (remainder 2, so you can apply one more D-Stoning at level 92.)
-   Maximum Life never hurts. So, first we apply Maximum Life bonus as
    much as possible.
-   \[Important\] Before you apply D-Stoning, **you have to check [the
    cap of the
    mod](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#bf7e4bac)**.
    The database says the cap of Maximum Life property is **capped at
    60%**. If you add more than 60% Maximum Life, only the level
    requirement is added for nothing.
-   One D-Stoning adds +4% Maximum Life. You need to apply D-Stoning 15
    times to add +60% Maximum Life.\
    (What happens if the cap can\'t be divided by 4? Assuming the cap of
    Maximum Life is 50%, you have two options. One is applying D-Stoning
    12 times and being satisfied with +48% Maximum Life. The other is
    applying D-Stoning 13 times to get +50% Maximum Life and giving up
    +2% Maximum Life.)

Materials
:   (Tyranium Ore) x 15 x 3

Effect
:   +180% Maximum Life

-   Now each piece still has the room for D-Stoning twice. It would be
    ok to add Vitality to gain more life. (Vitality doesn\'t work for
    mercenaries, tough.) Melee builds may want IAS. Hammerdins may want
    mana or FCR.
-   Here we assume the character needs +10% All Resist or such.
-   Which would be better, adding All Resist to each piece, or adding to
    a single piece?
-   If an item has too many mods, D2 can\'t display the mods, or even
    worse, it crashes. So you\'d better add the same mod to a single
    item as possible. Also, if you like to reroll the item later, to
    remove the unwanted D-Stoning, and if the unwanted mod only exists
    on one item, you have to reroll only one item.
-   So here we add All Resist to the boots twice. One D-Stoning adds +4%
    All Resist, so we get +8% All Resist. This is slightly less than he
    needs, but he\'ll be able to apply another D-Stoning when he gains
    two more levels.

Materials
:   (Holy Symbol) x 2

Effect
:   +8% All Resist

-   You can apply D-Stoning to the glove and belt as well. Of course you
    can reserve the room for D-stoning for the future.
-   You can apply Gem Melding, too. But Gem Melding adds multiple mods
    and Set items have many mods, so you must be careful not to add too
    many mods.

#### Sockets [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#x6813a0d "x6813a0d"){#x6813a0d .anchor_super} {#content_1_23}

-   Like in LoD, there is no reason not to make sockets on the end-game
    equipments. Please note gloves, belts, boots, rings, amulets and
    some charms can have socket(s).
-   The level requirement penalty is added to the requirement of the
    item itself or the socketables, whichever is the highest. Since we
    have applied D-Stoning heavily, we can\'t socket anything which has
    higher level requirement than the items themselves (20).
-   Unique Jewels are out of the question, because they have high level
    requirement.
-   Normal Gems\' level requirement is 14. They wouldn\'t be bad until
    you find and craft a good jewel.
-   Magic/Rare Jewels can have Forging, and Forging adds no level
    requirement. So the best bet would be, selectiong 3 good jewels with
    level requirement 20 or lower from the stash, and Tab Forging them.
    You can remove the Anvil Stone later and Tab forge another jewel, if
    you find a better one. Tab Forging doesn\'t benefit mercenaries, so
    use 2/3 rune Forging for them (ED, min damage, life leech, resists,
    etc.).

#### Tinkering [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201055904/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?ItemEnhancement#z3ed9381 "z3ed9381"){#z3ed9381 .anchor_super} {#content_1_24}

-   In R2G, the range of Tinkering became narrow, so you don\'t have to
    worry about your luck seriously. Anything which seems good for your
    build would be ok.

    Just like other enhancements, it would be better to add less kinds
    of mods to an item.
-   You can reroll Set Items and Unique Items to cancel Tinkering. But
    the reroll recipe isn\'t cheap, the range of Thinkering point is
    rather narrow now and the variable mods on Unique Items may get
    worse.
