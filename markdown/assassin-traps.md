### Traps [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20130315132937/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Traps#f952a7b4 "f952a7b4"){#f952a7b4 .anchor_super} {#content_1_0}

-   In LoD, **Sentry** type traps are treated as minions, and their
    damages aren\'t correctly boosted by caster\'s **Elemental
    Mastery**, **+% To Elemental Skill Damage** and **-% To Enemy
    Elemental Resist**. This problem is fixed in ES.

Required Level
:   1

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Improved damage. No cast delay

Pros
:   You can aim at specific monsters.

Cons
:   Less effective against moving monsters.

Notes
:   Cast delay is removed, but this advantage should be used to scatter
    the webs, not to stack the webs in one place, because next delay
    still exists and a monster can be hurt by the webs only once per
    second.

#### Blade Shield [†](https://web.archive.org/web/20130315132937/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Traps#c34f0662 "c34f0662"){#c34f0662 .anchor_super} {#content_1_3}

Required Level
:   6

Prerequisites
:   *None*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Longer duration. Also deals Lightning damage.

Pros
:   Triggers the special effects like Crushing Blow.

Cons
:   Short radius. 1 second of interval between each damage.

Notes
:   Using this skill reduces the durability of the weapon. CtC On
    Striking doesn\'t work, but CtC On Attack works.
:   Blade Shield is a good 1 pointer, the duration is low but as you add +skills to your
        equipment the duration improves enough. 1 point is the most you should have, with one
        glaring exception: pumping it to synergize Blade Sentinel if you expect to use Sentinels
        a lot.

        Really, the only build where I would say Blade Shield truly shines is an Iaigiri build.
        With that build, it will do decent damage, be in range to do that damage, and leech
        globs of life. For every other build I've tried, it isn't nearly as good.

        On melee builds using smaller one handed weapon(s), leave Blade Shield at 1. Such builds
        are elemental Martial Arts and kickers. With a short stubby weapon it doesn't hit for
        much, but the very fact that it is free leech makes it worth putting 1 point into.

        On ranged builds you can invest either 0 or 1 point, you are not likely to get hit much
        and when you do it will not help much anyway. Trappers and Shuriken builds fit here.
        (quoted from Blinn's post)

Required Level
:   12

Prerequisites
:   *Blade Shield (6)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   No recast delay. Rather than the duration and cast delay determining
    the max number of sentinels you can have out, now there is a max
    number that goes up with synergy from blade shield.

Pros
:   Triggers special effects like Crushing Blow. This skill can do
    massive damage to a small area, say an act boss and its minions, or
    scaling down as the area gets bigger do average damage as blades cut
    their way across the screen in every direction. Excellent for seal
    spawns and waves in the throne room.

Cons
:   Sometimes hard to control. As the max number of blades goes up,
    it\'s harder to tell if you have cast the max number.

Required Level
:   30

Prerequisites
:   *Shock Web (1), Lava Sentry (6), Lightning Sentry (18), Steam
    Sentry (24)*

Difference from the LoD version
:   Less Corpse Explosion damage.

Pros
:   Even 1 point works fine. Also good as a subskill for melee builds.

Cons
:   Requires a corpse to activate Corpse Explosion.

Notes
:   Corpse Explosion damage had been only 10\~25% of Monster\'s Life in
    the original ES 3.00. This was increased in the patch to 20\~40%,
    which is still lower than the LoD value. This is because Conviction
    Mercenary is very common with Trappers in ES, and curses like
    Amplify Damage is very common with Melee Sins.
