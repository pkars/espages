## Version {#m64d62d7}

### Can I use a character of LoD or an older version of ES? {#ua53c1d1}

Question
:   Can I use a character of LoD or an older version of ES?

Answer
:   ES 3.00 R series is incompatible with any other version than ES 3.00
    R series. You can use the old R series characters, but please note:

    -   The old jewels may be reset. You can cube those old jewels into
        new ones.
        -   Old Jewel -\> 3 Magic Jewels (ilvl=99)
        -   2 Old Jewels -\> 2 Rare Jewels (ilvl=99)
        -   5 Old Jewels -\> Unique Jewel (ilvl=99)
    -   The normal (non-upper) wands will get larger (1x2 -\> 1x3).
        Please make 1x1 space below those wands before update, or they
        will be lost.
    -   The old morphing charms no longer work in the latest version.
        Now you can transform into the monster by an oskill which is
        given as a full set bonus.

### Why does ES run on an older version of Lod, 1.10? // ES Warum läuft auf eine ältere Version von Lod, 1,10? {#cb9abd29}

Question/Frage
:   Why does ES run on LoD 1.10?\
    ES Warum läuft auf LoD 1,10?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

Answer/Antwort
:   ES 3.00 runs on 1.10 LoD, because new versions do not yet been fully
    support many useful plugins such as fully equippable mercenaries.\
    \
    Instead, ES launcher and an intelligent runs correctly with any
    version of LoD in the D2 folder, and you can still LoD, including
    the payment on Battle Net.\
    \
:   ES 3,00 auf 1,10 LoD auf, weil jede neue Version noch nicht vollständig
    analysiert wurde, und viele nützliche Plugins wie voll equippable
    Söldner nicht auf die neueren Versionen funktionieren.\
    \
    Stattdessen hat ES-Rakete und eine intelligente korrekt läuft mit jeder
    Version von LoD im D2-Ordner, und Sie können nach wie vor LoD spielen,
    einschließlich der Zahlung auf Battle Net.

### Why does ES bundle an older version of PlugY, 5.06? // Warum ES bündelt eine ältere Version von PlugY, 5,06? {#wf576d08}

Question/Frage
:   Why does ES Bundle PlugY 5.06?\
    Warum ES Bundles PlugY 5,06?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

Answer/Antwort
:   PlugY 5.06 is the stable version for LoD 1.10. PlugY 6.xx and 7.xx
    have been reported to cause TCP/IP problems, and most of the new
    features of them are not working with LoD 1.11b and ES.\
    \
    PlugY 5,06 ist die stabile Version für LoD 1.10. PlugY 6.xx und 7.xx Es
    wurde berichtet, führen TCP / IP-Probleme, und die meisten der neuen
    Features von ihnen sind für LoD 1.11b und nicht in ES arbeiten.


### Are there any restrictions for Mac version? {#sdd9e562}

## Install {#ke99faac}

### Nothing happens when I launch ES. {#cf15e670}

Question
:   Nothing happens when I launch ES

Answer
:   First, please make sure LoD 1.10 or higher (1.10, 1.11, 1.11b, 1.12,
    etc) is installed. A mod isn\'t a stand-alone game, and needs [the
    original game installed]{.ul}.\
    \
    Next, please make sure the Expansion disc is in your CD drive. The
    launcher may suppress the no-cd message in some environment. Please
    don\'t use any hacks like no-cd crack or loader.\
    \
    If you\'re using Daemon Tools and MiniCD, make sure that SafeDisc and
    SecuROM is selected in the advanced preferences.

do i need the disc eveen if i bought it online?

### ES randomly crashes when I directly run ES. {#n74943de}

Question
:   ES randomly crashes when I directly run ES by a shortcut with
    \"-direct -txt\"

Answer
:   Please make sure to use the shortcut created by the installer. The
    launcher now handles many things like swapping files according to
    the preferences you set, and ES doesn\'t run correctly without the
    launcher.

### D2 says the Expansion disc was not found. {#e9e4c808}

Question
:   D2 says the Expansion disc was not found, but the disc IS in the
    drive.

Answer
:   The drive letter may be changed because of connecting or removing
    some removable devices. In my case, clicking \"Ignore\" or \"Try
    Again\" 10ish times usually makes D2 find the CD.\
    \
    If your CD-ROM drive is having sporadic problems recognizing your
    Expansion disk, it could be a sign of age: CD-ROM drives often work
    intermittently and sporadically when they are wearing out. You can test
    your drive with a variety of other disks to see whether it is working
    properly. A drive that is wearing out will often be able to read some
    disks, but not others. Listening to a variety of un-scratched audio CDs
    is one good way to check. If you hear the drive stopping and re-starting
    several times when trying to read a CD or CD-ROM that you\'ve just
    inserted, either the disk is damaged (test it in another
    drive/computer), or the drive is wearing out or needs to be cleaned.

### My Expansion CD is damaged/broken/lost\...can I still play ES? {#n68f47bf}

Question
:   My Expansion CD is damage/broken/lost\...can I still play ES?

Answer
:   You cannot play ES without your Diablo II Expansion disk inserted.\
    \
    If your disk is damaged/broken you have several options:

    -   You can [get a replacement CD](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://www.blizzard.com/support/?id=adt0133p)
        from Blizzard, for a \$10 fee.
    -   If your CD is unreadable because it is scratched on the bottom,
        you can get a CD polishing kit from a local computer outlet or
        audio CD reseller. Kits typically include a tool for buffing out
        shallow scratches, and often a liquid that can be used to fill
        deep scratches. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.
        Scratches on the top (label side) cannot be repaired: the data
        of the CD is stored just below the label, so if that side of the
        disk is damaged, your only option is to get a replacement.
    -   If your CD is dirty, you can clean it with a cotton cloth,
        wiping outward from the center. Water and dishwashing liquid may
        also be used.

    Making a backup copy of CD is allowed in most countries. You can make a
    CD image file instead of a physical copy, and mount it using a virtual
    CD program like DAEMON tools. d2loader is a hack and isn\'t supported by
    ES, but those virtual CD programs are legal (as long as the backup is
    legal in your country) and run fine with ES. (Please ask any questions
    to the author or the company of those programs. Please don\'t ask it in
    Phrozen Keep.)


### ES doesn\'t run correctly with MH/HM/C3PO etc. {#me87092a}

Question
:   ES doesn\'t run correctly with MH/HM/C3PO etc.

Answer
:   Please don\'t use hacks. ES doesn\'t support any third party
    programs.



### ES says LoD or another MoD is running, but no other LoD is running. {#w4174005}


### ES says Another ES is running, but no other ES is running. {#z62491ae}

Question
:   ES shows an error message \"LoD or another MoD is running. Please
    quit it first.\", but no other LoD is running.

Question
:   ES shows a message \"Another ES is running. Are you launching 2nd
    ES?\", but no other ES is running.

Answer
:   If you open \"Diablo II\" folder by Windows Explorer or My Computer,
    the launcher misdetects it as a running Diablo II program. This is
    because both show the same string \"Diablo II\" in the title bar.
    Please close the folder and try again.


### How do I install ES on Linux or Windows Vista? {#o2db32ea}

Question
:   How do I install ES on Linux or Windows Vista?

Answer
:   Linux Installation Thread\
    [http://phrozenkeep.planetdiablo.gamespy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=45349](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://phrozenkeep.planetdiablo.gamespy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=45349)

Diablo II on Windows Vista

:   Diablo II - NOTE: For best results, set Compatibility Mode for application to Windows
    XP SP2 in the shortcut's properties and run as Administrator. This should allow all
    features of game to work properly, including LAN and Battle.Net play. If the game
    takes too long to start up, try disabling Aero Glass (or under compatability disable
    desktop composition).



## Multiplayer Games {#nd21e098}



### Can Mac users play with Windows users in a tcp/ip game? {#x3a1c273}

Question
:   Can Mac users play with Windows users in a tcp/ip game?

Answer
:   Windows version has many different settings (PlugY, etc.), and it is
    reported that D2 crashes when a Mac user enter Windows user\'s game
    or vice versa.\
    \
    Windows user can turn their ES into \"Mac compatible\" to play with Mac
    users, by running \"Mac compatible patch\" after you install the Windows
    version ES (R3D change).\
    \
    \"Mac compatible\" Windows version can co-exist with LoD 1.10, 1.11 or
    1.11b, and you can still use gamblefilter and ES preference menu. But it
    has other restrictions of Mac version (please see the [Mac
    restrictions](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?FAQ#sdd9e562)).
    Also, the map regeneration is always off, and you may have to disable
    /nopickup option when you play with Mac users.



### D2 crashes when I play a TCP/IP game. {#l0c6e601}

Question
:   D2 crashes when I play a TCP/IP game.

Answer
:   Please only use the original stash page. [Never touch the shared
    stash and the other pages of personal stash in TCP/IP
    games.]{style="color:red"} It can cause not only a crash but also a
    save data corruption.


### D2 crashes when I exit a TCP/IP game. {#ta62d06e}

Question
:   D2 crashes when I exit a TCP/IP game.

Answer
:   Usually too many items in the shared stash cause that error. Please
    reduce the items in the shared stash, by transferring the items to
    mule characters. The new feature of R3, stash switch will be useful
    to switch to an empty stash.\
    \
    Also make sure all players use the same version of ES, and the same
    settings of PlugY.　If the problem persists, make all players use the
    default preference setting (/no pickup is off, map regeneration is on).



### My character makes other players drop from a multiplayer game. {#sf41b29b}

Question
:   When one of my characters goes near other players in a multiplayer
    game, their D2 crashes and they drop from the game.

Answer
:   There is a limitation (or a bug) of LoD called 27 State Bug that if
    a player have more than 27 states he crashes nearby players in
    multiplayer games.\
    \
    Any effects like auras that gives you a special graphics always gives a
    stat. In addition to that, all passive skills and carry one items like
    White Odd Charm also give a stat.\
    \
    Barbarians tend to have this problem because they have many passive
    skills and warcries. Rich players who carry many unique charms, aura
    equipments and/or oskill passives also tend to have this problem.\
    \
    To avoid this, please reduce such equipment when you play in multiplayer
    games. Sorry about giving up good equipment, but you can still use it in
    solo games. You won\'t need it much in multiplayer games, because
    partied players usually enhance each other and become far stronger than
    monsters.

::: {.ie5}
  Effects that count for a stat          Examples
  -------------------------------------- -------------------------------
  Chilled                                
  Poisoned                               
  Slowed                                 
  Stunned                                
  <!--<br>-->
  Friendly Auras that boost you          Might
  Friendly Warcries that boost you       Battle Orders
  Other Friendly Spells that boost you   Enchant
  Armor Spells                           Shiver Armor
  Assassin Auras                         Burst of Speed
  Passive Skills                         Close Combat Mastery
  <!--<br>-->
  Curses                                 Amplify Damage
  Enemy Auras that weaken you            Conviction
  Enemy Warcries that weaken you         Battle Cry
  Other Enemy Spells that weaken you     Cloak of Shadows, Inner Sight
  <!--<br>-->
  Carry One Items                        White Odd Charm
:::

Your Conviction doesn\'t boost or weaken you, but gives you a stat
because it gives you the aura graphics.

Monster\'s Holy Shock deals Lightning damage to you, but it doesn\'t
give you a stat because your status isn\'t changed. Monster\'s Holy
Freeze give you a stat, however, because it gives you the slow effect
and the blue color.

The same skills from multiple sources don\'t stack. For example, Might
gives only one stat even if both you and your merc equip a Collar of
Minotaur.

### Do I have to kill normal Baal to create a HC character? {#d2e40ed6}

Question
:   Do I have to kill normal Baal to create a HC character?

Answer (Win)
:   If you kill normal Baal, that info is saved in the Windows registry.
    If you have killed Baal in the original LoD, you don\'t have to kill
    him in ES to create a HC character, unless the registry is cleared
    by a clean install of LoD.\
    If the registry is cleared, run regedit.exe, open
    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Blizzard Entertainment\\Diablo II**
    and set **AllowHardcore** to 1, to enable creating HC characters
    again.\
    If you aren\'t sure how to use regedit.exe, copy and paste the
    following lines to the notepad, save as \"temp.reg\" and double
    click it.

```{=html}

```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Diablo II]
    "AllowHardcore"=dword:00000001

Answer (Mac)
:   It\'s unknown how the info you killed Baal is saved in Mac. It\'s
    reported it seems that restoring a HC character, or a character who
    killed normal Baal, into the save folder enable creating HC
    characters again.



## Skills {#u2c3deb8}



### The synergy for Masteries/Passives doesn\'t work. {#w5207446}



### Strength of the Ancients/Vigor of the Ancients doesn\'t work {#z59b5ac0}

Question
:   Putting points into a synergy skill for Masteries/Passives never
    increases the damage, stats, etc. displayed in the LCS and skill
    tree.

```

Question
:   Putting points into Strength of the Ancients/Vigor of the Ancients
    never increases the stats displayed in the LCS and skill tree.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

Answer
:   They don\'t work until you start a new game, or re-equip any skill+
    item. This is a restriction of D2.\
    \
    Also, Strength of the Ancients and Vigor of the Ancients needs at least
    level 1 Luck of the Ancients. In the current version, LoA is a prereq of
    these skills, but an old character may not have LoA.



### My oskills sometimes disappear. {#o9c31621}

Question
:   One of my oskills sometimes disappears from the icon pool and
    becomes unselectable.

Answer
:   The reason had been unknown for a long time, but according to the
    post of Easytough, hovering the mouse cursor over an item with a
    skill bonus disables the oskill of the same kind you have.\
    \
    For example, you equip Enigma RW armor and you hover the mouse cursor
    over a staff with \"+1 To Teleport (Sorceress Only)\", the oskill
    Teleport disappear from your icon pool. This occurs only when the target
    has a class specific skill bonus (xxxxxx only) of that skill, and
    doesn\'t occur if the bonus is an oskill or a charged skill.\
    \
    This seems a bug of D2 itself and can\'t be fixed. **Reequipping the
    oskill item enables the oskill again.** But the lost minions don\'t come
    back, and the loss of the materials for Skeletons and Bone Golem will be
    problematic.



### My summons sometimes disappear. {#u0a9c6eb}

Question
:   Some or all of my summons sometimes disappear or are destroyed.

Answer
:   The oskills sometimes disappear, which results the summons granted
    by oskills being destroyed.\
    \
    Beside that, even the summons summoned by native skills occasionally
    disappear. When a summon falls behind you it usually catches up to
    you by teleporting. But when the distance increases too fast, (ie.
    you move too fast and/or the minion is blocked by an obstacle), it
    seems to fail to teleport. Monsters brought back to life using the
    necromancer Revive skill never teleport to keep up with you\...if
    you run too far ahead, they will disappear.\
    \
    If you have tons of Faster Run/Walk, consider reducing it or
    switching to walking (which will also increase your defense). (In
    R4, a recipe was added to make a negative Faster Run/Walk charm in
    case you lose your minions even if you walk.) When you come across
    an area with many obstacles, try to move a bit slowly. Someone
    reported that using Fade instead of BoS had reduced his Shadow
    Master\'s disappearing.\
    \
    Moving by (Oskill) Teleport gathers all your minions, which prevents
    the summons (including Revived monsters) from disappearing, too.
    Going back to town by Town Portal is a cheap alternative to gather
    the minions.



### Why revived monsters are so weak in ES? {#c53081f6}

Question
:   Why revived monsters are so weak in ES?

Answer
:   The skill itself is rather improved (longer duration, 250% more
    damage). But several reasons make revived monsters in early games
    not so useful.\
    [http://phrozenkeep.planetdiablo.gamespy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40450](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://phrozenkeep.planetdiablo.gamespy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40450)



### I hear some oskills are weaker than the native ones in ES. {#s265c107}

Question
:   I hear some oskills are weaker than the native ones in ES.

Answer
:   Yes they are.

Elemental Masteries grants 5% damage bonus per level. But if you put one
or more actual points into the skill it grants another 75% damage bonus.
So Sorceresses can receive 80% damage bonus from level 1 Mastery. This
is because Elemental Masteries are simply too strong as an oskill.\
Even if you play a Sorceress, an Elemental Mastery granted by an item
works like an oskill Mastery, because of the lack of actual points.

Oskill Dodge, Avoid and Evade have only 2/3 D/A/E chance of the native
ones. This is because other classes than Amazon don\'t show the D/A/E
animation and their D/A/E is very fast.

Oskill Fend have less attack number and ED% than the native ones. This
is because Fend attacks very fast with other classes than Amazon and
Sorceress. In recent versions, Oskill Fend is no longer spawned and
Oskill Killer Scythe is spawned instead. Oskill Killer Scythe has no
such penalty because Killer Scythe is a slower version of Fend balanced
for Necromancers, and it\'s well balanced for other 4 classes than
Amazons and Sorceresses, too. It\'s pointless for Amazons and
Sorceresses to use Oskill Killer Scythe.


### What are the caps of skill points in ES? {#t8e9409a}

Question
:   What are the caps of skill points in ES?

Answer
:   Level 1 and 6 skills: 30 points.\
    Level 12 and 18 skills: 25 points.\
    Level 24 and 30 skills. 20 points.

All skills can further be boosted with +skills items till level 100.


### What is Fend Bug? How can I avoid it? {#c3854226}

Question
:   What is Fend Bug?

Answer
:   All attacks except Concentrate and Iaigiri are interuppted by
    getting hit, blocking and D/A/E (Dodge, Avoid and Evade.) Multiple
    swing attacks like Fend can be \*internally\* interrupted as well,
    but the attack animation doesn\'t stop until all swings are
    displayed.

Question
:   Does Fend Bug occur only with Fend?

Answer
:   No. [It occurs with any multiple swing attacks (Zeal, Fend, Jab,
    Fury, Strafe, etc.)]{style="color:red"} But the bug is most
    noticeable with Fend because it has the longest animation among the
    multiple swing attacks in LoD.

Question
:   Is Fend Bug caused only by D/A/E?

Answer
:   No. Fend Bug is also caused by getting hit and blocking. But it\'s
    most noticeable with Fend, Fendazons usually don\'t block and D/A/E
    occurs much more frequently than getting hit. So it\'s wrongly
    believed that only D/A/E causes Fend Bug.

Question
:   How can I avoid Fend Bug?

Answer
:   In short, [keep clicking!]{style="color:red"} It can be too late to
    click when you see the attack animation is over. It\'s bad to hold
    down the mouse button, either.

Fend Bug is a display bug, and harmless by it self. But it prevents you
from knowing when the attack is actually over. The attack animation you
are watching may be a fake, and you may be losing the attack chance.

It had been said that Fend Bug makes you whiff, but it\'s incorrect.
It\'s you that doesn\'t start the new attack. Don\'t believe the
animation, and keep clicking to start a new attack in case the attack is
interuppted.


### What is D/A/E lock? Should I avoid taking D/A/E? {#h47a52ce}

Question
:   What is D/A/E lock?

Answer
:   When Dodge, Avoid or Evade is activated, the character gets busy to
    display the animation and can do no other things during that time.

This is also the case with blocking and hit recovery, but D/A/E lock is
more noticeable than other locks in LoD, because D/A/E animation is much
longer, and no item can make D/A/E faster. Also, Blizzard added a code
so that blocking doesn\'t show another animation just after a blocking
while D/A/E has no such code.

Question
:   Should I avoid taking D/A/E?

Answer
:   In LoD, D/A/E takes 8 frames (about 1/3 second) while in ES it takes
    only 1 frames (1/25 second). This means it needs to activate D/A/E 3
    times per second to completely lock you in LoD, but it needs 25
    times per second in ES. D/A/E lock is very short and hardly
    noticeable in ES.

Also, it had been said that (only) D/A/E causes Fend Bug. But blocking
and getting hit can cause Fend Bug as well, and you can easily avoid
Fend Bug (See the FAQ above). So it can no longer be the reason to avoid
taking D/A/E.

Generally speaking, D/A/E usually benefits more than it\'s drawback in
ES. But someone still prefer not taking D/A/E, and those people can do
without D/A/E. (In ES, Dodge also includes the function of Avoid and
Evade, and no skill requires Dodge as the prereq.)

For other classes than Amazon, D/A/E shows no animation, so it has no
drawback. (As written in the FAQ above, D/A/E interrupts the attack, but
getting hit also does, so D/A/E is always better.)


## Map / Quest {#mf6bb942}

Question: After I beat the ancients and I try to progress through to the
worldstone chamber\...instead of it saying worldstone chamber it says
nowhere. So I have tried repeatedly to click on because sometimes the
map itself is actually the worldstone chamber it\'s just labeled
incorrectly. However this freezes up the computer and brings up a diablo
2 error box. I have tried the map regen trick as mentioned below but to
no avail. Can someone figure out what this error is and how I can
progress into Nightmare?


### Some areas are too difficult to beat. {#g0e8cd52}

Question
:   I can\'t get the Viper Amulet because the Lost City is filled with
    Ghost Cows.\
    Some areas are filled with strong monsters and are too difficult to
    beat.

Answer
:   In LoD, there are very few areas to play after you beat Hell Baal,
    say, WSK, Cow Level, Pindle, and maybe The Pit. In ES, many areas
    you don\'t have to visit for the quests have been converted into
    special areas where you can get the best experience and drops like
    WSK and Cow Level.\
    Lost City (Lost Farm) is one of those special areas, and you don\'t
    have to visit Lost Farm for the quest, because the south entrance of
    Act 2 Sewer leads to the dungeons with the Viper Amulet and the
    Horadric Staff in ES.\
    Many maps other than the Lost City have been changed in ES. Please
    check the [Map
    section](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3map_n.htm)
    in ES Database for details.



### I can\'t find Flayer Dungeon. {#c299031a}

Question
:   I can\'t find Flayer Dungeon anywhere in Flayer Jungle.

Answer
:   One of the Sewer entrances in Upper Kurast leads to Flayer Dungeon.



### I can\'t find the downstairs from The Dead End to Nowhere. {#la422e1f}

Question
:   I can\'t find the downstairs from The Dead End to Nowhere.

Answer
:   The downstairs are hidden and not shown until you hover the mouse
    cursor on them, which is why the area is called \"The Dead End\".
    Hint: There always exists a \"landmark\" near the downstairs.



### I can\'t find a specific monster/area. {#g2b7c5aa}

Question
:   I can\'t find a specific monster/area.

Answer
:   D2 sometimes spawns a bugged map with some missing object (a super
    unique, a dungeon entrance, etc.)

This happens very infrequently, so D2 will regenerate a new vaild map in
the next game. [If you disable the map regeneration via the preference
menu, temporarily enable it]{.ul} to reset the bugged map.



### Do there happen World Event and Hellfire Torch quest in ES? {#nb3f2aca}

Question
:   Do there happen the World Event and Hellfire Torch quest in ES?

Answer
:   The World Event (Diablo Clone) is a feature of Battle Net. But PlugY
    emulates this event in SP and TCP/IP games, so if PlugY is working,
    it does happen, even you sell nothing to the NPC. (In Mac version
    ES, PlugY isn\'t available and it doesn\'t happen.)

You can cause the World Event by selling a new item Devil\'s Food,
instead of Stone of Jordan. Devil\'s Foods can be made from unwanted
unique rings and amulets via Rerolling Orb. Now you can cause the World
Event very cheaply, and the random encount chance has been improved by
33%. Diablo Clone doesn\'t always drop a unique charm, but has 10%
chance to drop a unique charm, 30% chance to drop a rare charm and 60%
chance to drop a magic charm.

Hellfire Torch quest is a feature of LoD 1.11 Battle Net, so it doean\'t
happen in ES which is based on LoD 1.10.



### What\'s the Devil\'s Food message I see every 5 minutes? {#mabf458a}

Question
:   I constantly see the message that Devil\'s Foods are sold to the
    merchants. What is this message?

Answer
:   That is an emulation of World Event, a feature of Battle Net. On
    Battle Net, you see that Stones of Jordan are sold, but it doesn\'t
    mean any SOJ is actually sold in your game. In ES, a new item
    Devil\'s Food is used instead of SOJ to cause the World Event.
    Please also see the above question.



### Quel-Khek doesn\'t seem to give the proper reward for my class. How do you use the reward? {#g8e9730c}

Question
:   Readme says Quel-Khek gives the materials for Class Crafting. But he
    gave me a Perfect Obsidian, a Flag and a Dragon Stone and my
    character\'s class is Sorceress. How do you use these materials?

Answer
:   The trick is the Flag. To make a Perfect Sapphire, please cube the
    Perfect Obsidian and the Flag with a Chipped Sapphire. To make a
    Crushed Gem, right click the Dragon Stone several times. Then you
    are alomst ready to do Class Crafting.\
    Sorry but the Chipped Gem and the junk jewel are not included in the
    kit. Please prepare them for yourself.



## Horadric Cube {#r06b1692}



### How can I get a new Horadric Cube? {#z3aec8ae}

Question
:   I threw my cube onto the ground, forgot to pick it up and left the
    game. How can I get a new one?

Answer
:   Pass the cube from a new dummy character via PlugY\'s shared stash.
    If you can\'t use PlugY, launch two instances of ES on a PC. Host a
    TCP/IP game by the character. Join with a new dummy character. Pass
    the cube.



### Why do I sometimes get a rare ring/amulet when I try to make a unique? {#s3ea6601}

Question
:   Why do I sometimes get a rare ring/amulet when I try to make a
    unique?

Answer
:   There are three recipies for making a uniqe ring/amulet\...you can
    re-roll 7 rares or three uniques into a new unique, or you can use
    secret recipie 6 to create a unique. The secret recipie will always
    produce a unique, and can produce any ring/amulet, regardless of the
    character using the recipie.\
    \
    However, the re-roll recipies are limited by the level of the
    character re-rolling the rings/amulets. You get a rare when the
    ring/amulet that came out did not have a high enough ilvl to become
    a unique (that is, if your clvl is below 15, or if you tried to make
    a class ring/amulet, and your clvl is below 65). Because the ilvl of
    the output is 70% of your clvl (rounded down), you may have to reach
    a higher clvl than you expect in order to get the ring/amulet you
    want. Here is a list of rings/amulets, and the character levels
    required to cube them:

    -   Lvl 10 Fallen Star or Lovers\' Pendant: clvl 15
    -   Lvl 20 Dragon Eye or Eye of the Witch: clvl 29
    -   Lvl 30 Ring of Vengance or Collar of the Minotaur: clvl 43
    -   Lvl 40 Elemental Jewel or Beads of the Guardian: clvl 58
    -   Lvl 50 Iron Thimble or Roaring Thunder: clvl 72
    -   Lvl 60 Zodiac Band or Eye of the Beholder: clvl 86
    -   Lvl 75 The One Ring or Spellcaster\'s Aide: cannot be made using
        unique ring/amulet re-roll

If you put a class ring/amulet in last, you will get a ring/amulet for
that class out. The most common reason for getting a rare ring/amulet is
accidentally placing a class ring/amulet in the cube last when your
character has not reached level 65. Required clvls to get class
rings/amulets are as follows:

-   req lvl 45 class ring/amulet: clvl 65
-   req lvl 60 class ring/amulet: clvl 86
-   top class ring/amulet: cannot be made using unique ring/amulet
    re-roll



### How can I reroll a class specific ring/amulet? {#rae68b87}

Question
:   Is it possible to reroll rings and amulets into a specific one?

Answer
:   The last one you put into the cube determines the type of jewelry.
    For example, if the last input is an Amazon ring, the output is an
    Amazon ring, too.\
    When you use a Rerolling Orb, use an alternative form of Dragon
    Stone instead of a Key. Cubing with a Spider Silk rerolls an Amazon
    ring, for example.



### How can I get Spider\'s Silk, Holy Symbol, Crushed Gem, etc.? {#x4fc6e8b}

Question
:   How can I get Spider\'s Silk, Holy Symbol, Crushed Gem, etc.? I\'ve
    never seen those items drop.

Answer
:   A Dragon Stone turns into 7 forms cyclically by right click. All
    monsters drop only Dragon Stones, and you have to make the ones you
    need by right-clicking D-Stones. (The only exception is the unique
    Panther Woman nearby the Horadric Cube Chest, who drops a Forging
    Hammer.)

### Why stacked items aren\'t fully replenished by Cube? {#re97e72b}

Question
:   Why stacked items like quivers and javelins aren\'t fully
    replenished by Cube?

Answer
:   It\'s because our little Cuby can do math only up to 255. Don\'t
    scold him, arrow\'s maximun stack size used to be 250 in Classic D2,
    which was the largest number he needed to count.\
    (R5 Change) With a new method, now quivers are fully replenished by
    cubing. Throwing Weapons are replenished to 255 as before.


## In-Game Troubles {#p4844b1d}



### ES crashes when I enter Act 5. {#t23f5607}

Question
:   ES crashes when I enter Act 5. (on a Macintosh computer)

Answer
:   This happens when you try to use Eastern Sun with LoD 1.11. On a
    Macintosh, you must be using LoD 1.10 or 1.10b (preferably the
    latter). Please uninstall D2, do a clean new install of D2 and LoD,
    and then patch it to version 1.10b. You can download the patch from
    [Blizzard\'s
    FTP](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/Mac/).

Question
:   ES crashes when I enter Act 5. (on a Windows computer)

Answer
:   The Windows version of ES is designed to run correctly with LoD 1.10
    or 1.11 installed. The most common cause of this crash in the full
    PC version is trying to launch ES without using the shortcuts placed
    in the start menu. ES will only run correctly when launched using
    \"ES_300r_launcher.exe\" from the ES folder, or the shortcuts on the
    start menu.\
    \
    If problems persist when using the launcher, it usually indicates an
    install problem, please see the [Install
    Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://miyoshino.la.coocan.jp/eswiki/?Install%20Guide "Install Guide (1922d)").



### ES crashes when I talk to Warriv after killing Andariel. {#m3a3d78b}

Question
:   ES crashes when I talk to Warriv after killing Andariel.

Answer
:   According to the official FAQ of Diablo II, it happens when you use
    the \"-ns\" (no sound) command line parameter, but it\'s reported it
    sometimes happens without the parameter.\
    \
    It seems the crash doesn\'t always happen. So please save and exit
    after killing Andariel and before talking to Warriv, and then talk
    to Warriv in a new game so that you don\'t need to kill Andariel
    again even if the game crashes.\
    \
    If the problem persists, reinstalling the sound card/driver may
    help.



### I can\'t enter the dungeon entrance/stairs. {#h9a273d8}

Question
:   I can\'t enter the dungeon entrance/stairs.

Answer
:   In ES, more skills can be assinged to the left mouse button. This
    makes your key assign more flexible, but some of those skills
    prevent you from clicking the dungeon entrance/stairs. Please assign
    Normal Attack to your left mouse button.


### My character has \'frozen\' in place and can\'t move. {#j741fb0d}

Question
:   Not entirely sure what causes this, but twice now in Act 2 my barb
    has \'frozen\' in place and cant move. Seems to happen when I get
    knocked back in a certain fashion and it will just keep me there.
    Cant do skills but I can make a TP but cant go into it. Only fix I
    have done is to restart the game.

Answer
:   Try taking off a piece of equipment, or doing a weapon switch by
    pressing \"W\". Common in LoD. One reported reason for this is the
    Str/Dex bug\...if you don\'t have enough base Strength or Dexterity
    to equip your weapon (that is, if you\'re relying on Str/Dex from
    charms or equipment to be able to equip it), and you level in the
    middle of using certain skills, you can become frozen in place until
    you un-equip and re-equip your weapon (Whirlwind was implicated as a
    skill with this problem).\



### Monster\'s dead bodies block my passage/loot. {#ud6dc60c}

Question
:   Some monsters leave dead bodies which block my passage/loot.

Answer
:   Duriels in Marsh of Pain and Siege Beasts in Act 5 leave dead bodies
    that cannot be walked over. If you don\'t have Teleport or Leap,
    please be careful not to be surrounded by them, particularly near
    the edge of a map or on a bridge. The dead bodies may also make your
    loot unclickable.\
    \
    If there aren\'t no detours, or the loot is too precious to give up, try
    to move 2 screens away and then go back there. The dead bodies will
    disappear like the normal dead bodies.

### How does MF work? Does MF increase the drop of XXXX? {#q1678e33}

Question
:   How does MF work? Does MF increase the drop of XXXX?

Answer
:   MF doesn\'t increase the drop amount at all, but improves the
    quality of items which can be Magic or better. If an item doesn\'t
    have its magic version, MF doesn\'t work at all. MF fully works for
    Magic (Blue) items, but less effectively for Rares, Sets and
    Uniques.

### I can\'t make the maximum number of sockets on a white item. {#y124bf1d}

Question
:   I can\'t make the maximum number of sockets on a white item.

Answer
:   The socket number is also limited by the ilvl (item level) of the
    target item.

::: {.ie5}
                     MaxSock1   MaxSock25   MaxSock40
  ----------------- ---------- ----------- -----------
  Weapons               3           5           6
  Helms                 3           3           4
  Body Armor            3           4           6
  Shields               3           3           4
  Paladin Shields       3           4           4
:::

Please see the Body Armor line. MaxSock1=3 means, if the ilvl is lower
than 25, the socket number is capped at 3. If the ilvl is between 25 and
39, the socket number is capped at 4. If the ilvl is equal to or higher
than 40, the socket number isn\'t capped, because the largest socket
number on body armor is 6. The items not listed here can always have the
maxmum number of sockets.

-   If PlugY is available, the ilvl is displayed on the item. If you
    can\'t use PlugY, following rules will help to know the ilvl of an
    item.
-   If the item is dropped by a monster, the ilvl is equal to the level
    of the monster. As a rule of thumb, [the items dropped in NM Act 3
    and later can have the maximum number of sockets]{.ul}.
-   The ilvl of sold items is your clvl (character level) + 5, but is
    capped at 12 in normal Act 1 and capped at 20 in normal Act 2.
-   The white items created by a cube recipe has the same ilvl as the
    previous item.



### What ilvl the target item has to have for a specific affix? {#n9f09948}

Question
:   Is the level of available affixes equal to the ilvl of item?\
    If for exmaple, I was to re-roll a Ninja To to have Bloodlust
    prefix, what clvl would I had to be? And what ilvl the sword had to
    have?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

Answer
:   The level of available affixes (alvl) is equal to the ilvl only when
    the level (qlvl) of the target item is 0.\
    \
    Rings, Amulets and Grand Charms have no level (qlvl=0), so alvl = ilvl
    for them. Weapons and armor have the level, so you need to use the [ilvl
    calculator](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://hpcgi3.nifty.com/miyoshino/d2/ilvl.cgi)
    to know the clvl/ilvl you need.

Example

1. Open the [ilvl calculator](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://hpcgi3.nifty.com/miyoshino/d2/ilvl.cgi).\
2. Check the [Base
Weapon](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3weap_n.htm#assn)
page of the database to see the qlvl of Ninja-to. It\'s qlvl is 37 (Lvl
column).\
3. Put 37 in the first text window of the calculator.\
4. Leave the second window 0, because Ninja-to isn\'t listed, so it\'s
magic level is 0.\
5. Check the
[Prefixes](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3pref_n.htm)
page of the database to see the alvl of Bloodlust. It\'s alvl is 75 (Lvl
column).\
6. Put 75 in the third window and push the CALC button. Here is the
answer.

    Required Item Level of the Target Item 87
    Required Monster Level to Drop 87
    Required Character Level to Reroll 87
    Required Character Level to Gamble (Min Chance) 83
    Required Character Level to Gamble (Max Chance) 92


### How many affixes can you get on a single item? {#fb81770f}

Question
:   How many affixes can you get on a single item?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

Answer
:   A rare item can get up to 3 prefixes and 3 suffixes.\
    A crafted item can get up to 3 prefixes and 3 suffixes, too. But the
    total is capped at 4.\
    (3 prefixes and a suffix, 2 perfixes and 2 suffixes or a prefix and
    3 suffixes)\
    A magic item has 25% chance to have both prefix and suffix, 25%
    chance to have only a prefix, and 50% chance to have only a suffix.

[Prefixes](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3pref_n.htm)\
[Suffixes](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://homepage3.nifty.com/miyoshino/es/es3suff_n.htm)

You will need to look for 3 things for the affix to spawn for you;\
1. There must be a 1 in the \"rare\" column on those pages, for rare and
crafted items.\
2. It must meet the \"Item Type\". Either \'weap\' or \'mele\' for a
melee weapon, for example.\
3. This isn\'t really a requirement but more of a reminder; two affixes
for the same group will not spawn on the same item. (ie; you can get
Cruel and Ferocious on the same item. Or Cruel and Bloodlust, but you
can\'t get Bloodlust on rares anyway\...



### What would be the best combination of Affixes for weapons? {#k28229dc}

Question
:   What would be the best combination of Affixes for weapons?

Answer
:   For prefixes you want ED.\
    IF you get perfect Cruel and Grandmaster that 500% ED. On top of
    that you can get Screaming for 3-300% Max ED (/clvl) or Fool\'s for
    2-250 Max Dmg (/clvl). or for a perfect pure ED roll you can get
    Heavy for another 200% ED. With Cruel/Grandmaster/Heavy you can get
    up to 700%ED before D-Stoning.

For Suffixes you only have one choice for ED% and that of Grandmastery
which grants 20% IAS and 100% ED. Other useful suffixes are;

    of Piercing (Ignore Traget Defense)
    of Quickness (40% IAS)
    of Ages (Indestructible)
    of Skillmaster (oskills)
    of "Skill Name" (CtC)
    of Aurora (Aura when Equipped)

Or other useful mods like min or max dmg, leech, stats, or DS/CB/OW.
Getting the perfect combination of these is near impossible. Good
Luck\...


### Some skills never appear as a staffmod. {#n0fac7d9}



### Some skills never appear as a random skill bonus. {#s1c89c16}

Question
:   Some skills never appear as a staffmod. Akara never sells a staff
    with +X To Time Stop, for example.\
    Some skills never appear as a random skill bonus. Sand Storm never
    appears on Yagul\'s Wrath, for example.

Answer
:   The original D2 has 30 skills per classs and 5 new skills are added
    to each class in ES. The original skills must have the same skill ID
    as in LoD, so the 5 additional skills have the apart (inconsecutive)
    skill ID. (The original Sorceress skills have \#36～\#65 and the
    additional Sorceress skills have \#367～\#370, for example)\
    Due to this apart skill ID, the additional skills can\'t appear as a
    staffmod, or a random skill bonus.

### Staffmods of some high level skills often appear on low level items. {#w65157c7}

Question
:   Staffmods of some high level skills often appear on low level items,
    and raise their level requirement.

Answer
:   Yes, it\'s annoying, but it\'s a compromise to fix another major
    problem.

Many skills have different req levels in ES (e.g. Teleport is a lv 1
skill rather than a lv 18 skill). The staffmods are assigned based on
the skill ID, so to have the skills appear as staffmods at the proper
level, you need to change the skill IDs. In previous ES versions (patch
N and before) the skill IDs were changed so that the staffmods work
properly.

But then it proved this change makes many skills not working properly.
Many skills are hardcoded and related to their specific ID (e.g. the
damage synergy from Holy Shield to Smite only works if both skills have
the original ID).

Working skills are more important than the staffmods, so the skill IDs
were changed back to the LoD values in patch R (This is one of the main
reasons for the save game incompatibility).


### When I can\'t pick up the unique charm, what should I do? {#t3484676}

Question
:   When I can\'t pick up the unique charm, what should I do?

Answer
:   Just like with Annihilus in LoD, you can\'t pick up a unique charm
    if you have the same charm already. Perfect Cell Unique SC and Vlad
    Tepe\'s Sustenance Unique SC are different charms, for example, so
    you can carry both.\
    If you can use PlugY (ie. single play on Windows), go back to town
    and store the old charm in the shared stash. Then you can pick up
    the new one. You can check which one is better, and make a Maple
    Leaf from the bad one. Or you can reserve one of them in the shared
    stash for another character.\
    If you can\'t use PlugY, you can still pick up the new one by
    dropping the old one onto the ground. But you can\'t exit the game
    with both charms, so there is no choice other than making a Maple
    Leaf.



### My \"ED + Max/Min Dam\" jewel doesn\'t work correctly. {#uc41c245}

Question
:   My \"ED + Max/Min Dam\" jewel doesn\'t increase the total damage
    correctly.

Answer
:   The ED part of an \"ED + Max/Min Dam\" jewel doesn\'t work [when
    socketed into armor]{.ul}. This is a known bug of D2. Fortunately
    you can pull out the jewel in ES, and can socket it into a weapon.



### New CtC Meteor, etc. have no delay while old ones have some. Why? {#ddc40983}

Question
:   I found CtC Meteor on recent items has no delay, but the same mods
    on my old items still have some delay. Why?

Answer
:   CtC (Chance to Cast) mods of following skills [spawned in R5G]{.ul}
    or later use a special version of that skill and no longer make the
    skill icon red.\
    This change doesn\'t affect the existing items. So if you want the
    no-delay version, you need to reroll the item (or reactivate the
    runeword.)

-   Fist of the Heavens
-   Flame Wave, Meteor, Lightning Hydra, Blizzard, Frozen Orb



## Minions / Hirelings {#d24ab9a9}


### My merc loses life everytime he/she gains a level. {#deb3063a}

Question
:   My merc loses life everytime he/she gains a level.

Answer
:   D2 has a bug in calculating the life of a merc when he/she levels
    up. Certain mods that give her bonus life are ignored which is why
    she ends up with less life. The same effect happens in LoD, only
    there these mods are quite rare which is why the bug is not seen.\
    They wrongly believe they are fully healed, so their life
    regeneration doesn\'t start until their life is changed. This can be
    done by letting them take some damage, letting them leech some life,
    giving them a healing pot, or quickly removing the item that gives
    them bonus life and putting it back on (this last one activates
    their regeneration even though it initially leaves them with the
    incomplete life total they started at).\
    If you hire an act 3 sorcerer you\'d better give him a healing pot
    or quickly remove then reequip a piece of his gear, because they
    can\'t leech.

### What\'s the Uber build or char in ES? {#x9d256ff}

Question
:   What\'s the Uber build or char in ES?

Answer
:   None. Or in the other words, all builds or characters can be uber.\
    You can read many good posts
    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=40185).



### How to backup my shared stash or start a fresh shared stash? {#cd7d635f}

Question
:   How to backup my shared stash, or start a fresh shared stash?

Answer
:   Backup the file **\_LOD_SharedStashSave.sss** in the save folder. To
    start a fresh shared stash, delete the old stash after backup, and
    PlugY automatically makes a new empty shared stash.\
    In recent versions, you can use the stash switcher to switch two
    shared stashes.



### How Elemental Masteries work with Enchant type spells? {#i09cfb62}

Question

How Elemental Masteries works with Enchant type spells?

Answer



#### Definition {#sf86a752}

-   Elemental Masteries here includes Sorceress **Fire/Cold/Lightning
    Mastery** and the mod **+XX% To Fire/Cold/Lightning/Poison Skill
    Damage**.
-   Enchant type spells include **Enchant**, **Holy Fire/Freeze/Shock**
    and **Venom**. Charged Strike and Vengeance aren\'t an Enchant type
    spell for example, because their elemental damage doesn\'t work when
    you attack with another skill like Jab and Zeal.



#### Does Fire Mastery increase the damage of Enchant twice for melee attack, and once for ranged attack? {#c76f328d}

-   It seems widely believed, like posted
    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111906/http://forums.diabloii.net/showthread.php?t=464619).
    But the LCS shows Fire Mastery works twice for both melee and ranged
    attack. And the Arreat Summit only says \"Using Enchant on ranged
    weapons now boosts the damage a variable amount\".



#### How Fire Mastery works with Enchant {#kf415513}

-   The Fire Mastery of the caster of Enchant increases the listed
    damage bonus of Enchant.\
    (This effect is halved for all Enchant type spells in ES.)
-   The Fire Mastery of the attacker increases the fire damage enchanted
    on the weapon.
-   So if the caster is the attacker, Fire Mastery works twice,
    regardless of melee or ranged attack.



#### Unknown Factor \"missile pct\" {#ufccd5cc}

-   Why did they think ranged attacks receive less bonus? I found a
    column named **missile pct** in the line of Enchant in skills.txt
    and it\'s set to **33**. This value looks like the effectiveness of
    Enchant to ranged weapons.
-   I\'m not sure if it\'s actually working, because the LCS shows the
    full damage for ranged weapons. But the theory \"Fire Mastery works
    only once for ranged attack\" may be misled by this column. Also, if
    this works, it explains the comment of Blizzard, \"Using Enchant on
    ranged weapons now boosts the damage a variable amount\" well.
-   This value is changed to **50** in ES, because the penalty seems too
    severe in case it\'s working.


#### Conclusion {#xb7682d3}

-   All Enchant type skills are affected by Elemental Mastery twice
    (when the spell is cast and when the character attacks), regardless
    of melee or ranged attack.
-   The **missile pct** column of Enchant [may or may not be
    working]{.ul}. If it\'s working, Enchant only boosts ranged weapons
    by 33% in LoD and by 50% in ES. But the LCS doesn\'t show any effect
    of **missile pct**. Holy Fire/Freeze/Shock and Venom have no such
    column, so they fully work for ranged weapons.

Questiion
:   How is this Gamble Chit working if I buy more than once of same

Answer

    unique one, for example. Strictly speaking, you should buy and
    identify the chit one by one, not to get any redundant ones. Though
    the chance is slim, and buying 5 or 10 chits in a row is less time
    consuming.
