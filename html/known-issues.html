<p>Cheat/Hack Programs<br />
Most of cheat/hack programs like map revealing utilities and loaders do cause troubles with ES or PlugY. ES never support such programs. Please also note any cheat/hack discussion in ES forum is prohibited by Phrozen Keep TOS.</p>
<p>Hirelings and Equipment<br />
The items given to a hireling can be lost or get invisible in very rare cases. This is a bug of D2MercMod plugin. Giving an item at the hireling panel is safer than dropping it on the hireling icon. You can take out the lost (invisible) item by giving a new item on the item slot in some cases.</p>
<p>Act 5 Hirelings and Dual Wielding<br />
Act 5 Hirelings can't equip the shield or the 2nd weapon. If you give them a 1H sword as the 2nd weapon, it's lost forever.</p>
<p>Hirelings losing life on level up<br />
If hirelings have Max Life bonus, they lose some life when leveled due to a bug of D2. The life regeneration doesn't start until they are injured, they leech life, or you give a healing pot.</p>
<p>Magic/Rare/Unique Quivers<br />
Unlike magic throwing weapons, magic quivers disappear when used up. Please don't overlook the red quantity warning icon.</p>
<p>Cow Level Waypoint<br />
When you select Cow WP, you jump where Cow Portal leads. WP is near Cow King's corral. Please make sure to activate Cow Level WP *BEFORE* you kill Cow King.</p>
<p>Charged Minions<br />
Charged minions can't exist if you have no charge. This means if you cast the last charge, the minion disappears immediately. So please don't use them up. In the patch, all charged minions are increased by 1 for this reason.</p>
<p>Arctic Blast Glitches in Wereform<br />
The spray of Arctic Blast is invisible when cast in wereform. You can't auto-fire Arctic Blast in wereform. (You have to repeat clicking.) This feature is offered as is, instead of being deleted, by the request of users.</p>
<p>Other Graphics Glitches<br />
The effect of Venom and Telekinesis is invisible when cast as a CtC skill, but they normally deal damage. Lightning Fury's sparks seem to carry Poison damage and Cold Damage. But the green/blue color upon monsters disappears in a second, and don't last for their full duration. So it is considered a display bug.</p>
<p>Too Many Properties on an Item<br />
If an item is given too many properties, they aren't displayed, or in the worst case, D2 crashes when you cursor over it. In Socketing, Forging and D-Stoning, Please try to give an item less kind of properties as possible. Especially Set Items and Unique Jewels have many properties. So it's not recommended to use them together. (It may work, but vulnerable to heavy D-Stoning.) When you socket Unique Jewels to a multi-socket item, using only one kind of Jewels would be safer. When you D-Stoning an item, adding an existing property would be safer than adding a new property. If an item gets corrupted due to too many properties, grab something, then drop it over the bad item. Now you are grabbing it without seeing the properties. Drop it into the Cube for unsocketing.</p>
<p>Growing D2yymmdd.txt<br />
D2 wrongly detects addressing a set item by its name in cube recipes as an error, and the error log D2yymmdd.txt in the D2 folder grows large. This file is automatically deleted after a week or so.</p>
<p>Tribal Masteries<br />
Skill Tab reads Tribal Masteries, but the description on items reads Masteries. This is a limitation of D2. (Combat Masteries are displayed in the same way.)</p>
<p>Morphing Bonus<br />
The morphing bonus is removed from all sets, because it affects some skills like Druid wereforms even if disabled. Instead, you can cube a morphing charm with those sets. It's known that Whirlwind, Leap, Leap Attack and all Traps don't work in monsters from. Please see the Set Item section of the database.</p>
<p>Shadow Master's Headgear<br />
Shadow Master always wears a Cap or its upper version, instead of mimicking caster's headgear. This is to avoid oskill Shadow Master causing an error when the caster equips a Druid Pelt or a Barbarian Helm.</p>
<p>Unclickable Entrances/Stairs<br />
Assigning some skills to Left Mouse Button sometimes causes this issue. Please switch Left Mouse Button to Normal Attack and click the entrance again.</p>
<p>Character Select Screen<br />
The new equipments which don't exist in LoD may not be displayed correctly in the character select screen. This is a limitation of D2.</p>
<p>Psychic Slash on Left Click<br />
When Psychic Slash is on the left click slot, pressing shift while running shows your character 'gliding'.</p>
