<p>Cheat/Hack Programs<br>
Most of cheat/hack programs like map revealing utilities and loaders do cause<br>
troubles with ES or PlugY. ES never support such programs. Please also note<br>
any cheat/hack discussion in ES forum is prohibited by Phrozen Keep TOS.</p>
<p>Hirelings and Equipment<br>
The items given to a hireling can be lost or get invisible in very rare cases.<br>
This is a bug of D2MercMod plugin. Giving an item at the hireling panel is<br>
safer than dropping it on the hireling icon. You can take out the lost<br>
(invisible) item by giving a new item on the item slot in some cases.</p>
<p>Act 5 Hirelings and Dual Wielding<br>
Act 5 Hirelings can't equip the shield or the 2nd weapon. If you give them a<br>
1H sword as the 2nd weapon, it's lost forever.</p>
<p>Hirelings losing life on level up<br>
If hirelings have Max Life bonus, they lose some life when leveled due to a bug<br>
of D2. The life regeneration doesn't start until they are injured, they leech<br>
life, or you give a healing pot.</p>
<p>Magic/Rare/Unique Quivers<br>
Unlike magic throwing weapons, magic quivers disappear when used up. Please<br>
don't overlook the red quantity warning icon.</p>
<p>Cow Level Waypoint<br>
When you select Cow WP, you jump where Cow Portal leads. WP is near Cow King's<br>
corral. Please make sure to activate Cow Level WP *BEFORE* you kill Cow King.</p>
<p>Charged Minions<br>
Charged minions can't exist if you have no charge. This means if you cast the<br>
last charge, the minion disappears immediately. So please don't use them up.<br>
In the patch, all charged minions are increased by 1 for this reason.</p>
<p>Arctic Blast Glitches in Wereform<br>
The spray of Arctic Blast is invisible when cast in wereform. You can't auto-<br>
fire Arctic Blast in wereform. (You have to repeat clicking.) This feature is<br>
offered as is, instead of being deleted, by the request of users.</p>
<p>Other Graphics Glitches<br>
The effect of Venom and Telekinesis is invisible when cast as a CtC skill,<br>
but they normally deal damage.<br>
Lightning Fury's sparks seem to carry Poison damage and Cold Damage. But the<br>
green/blue color upon monsters disappears in a second, and don't last for their<br>
full duration. So it is considered a display bug.</p>
<p>Too Many Properties on an Item<br>
If an item is given too many properties, they aren't displayed, or in the worst<br>
case, D2 crashes when you cursor over it.<br>
In Socketing, Forging and D-Stoning, Please try to give an item less kind of<br>
properties as possible.<br>
Especially Set Items and Unique Jewels have many properties. So it's not<br>
recommended to use them together. (It may work, but vulnerable to heavy<br>
D-Stoning.) When you socket Unique Jewels to a multi-socket item, using only<br>
one kind of Jewels would be safer. When you D-Stoning an item, adding an<br>
existing property would be safer than adding a new property.<br>
If an item gets corrupted due to too many properties, grab something, then<br>
drop it over the bad item. Now you are grabbing it without seeing the<br>
properties. Drop it into the Cube for unsocketing.</p>
<p>Growing D2yymmdd.txt<br>
D2 wrongly detects addressing a set item by its name in cube recipes as an<br>
error, and the error log D2yymmdd.txt in the D2 folder grows large. This file<br>
is automatically deleted after a week or so.</p>
<p>Tribal Masteries<br>
Skill Tab reads Tribal Masteries, but the description on items reads Masteries.<br>
This is a limitation of D2. (Combat Masteries are displayed in the same way.)</p>
<p>Morphing Bonus<br>
The morphing bonus is removed from all sets, because it affects some skills<br>
like Druid wereforms even if disabled. Instead, you can cube a morphing charm<br>
with those sets. It's known that Whirlwind, Leap, Leap Attack and all Traps<br>
don't work in monsters from. Please see the Set Item section of the database.</p>
<p>Shadow Master's Headgear<br>
Shadow Master always wears a Cap or its upper version, instead of mimicking<br>
caster's headgear. This is to avoid oskill Shadow Master causing an error when<br>
the caster equips a Druid Pelt or a Barbarian Helm.</p>
<p>Unclickable Entrances/Stairs<br>
Assigning some skills to Left Mouse Button sometimes causes this issue. Please<br>
switch Left Mouse Button to Normal Attack and click the entrance again.</p>
<p>Character Select Screen<br>
The new equipments which don't exist in LoD may not be displayed correctly in<br>
the character select screen. This is a limitation of D2.</p>
<p>Psychic Slash on Left Click<br>
When Psychic Slash is on the left click slot, pressing shift while running shows<br>
your character 'gliding'.</p>
